stinky britches by alanis morissette
yeah stinky stinky britches
children did you say hi to mr twig
hi boys how are you
when is mr hat coming back
i told you never say his name in my presence
but we hate mr twig mr twig sucks
yeah
stinky britches you got stinky
it just so happens that mr twig is far more stable than mr hat could ever be so he's the better puppet now
he'd be better used as a coat rack
how dare you come on mr twig
hello there children
hey chef
you got stinky britches stinky
what did you say
he singing some new hit song
eric where did you hear that song
its all over the place on the radio mtv everywhere
well i'll be sodomized on christmas
what dude
children i wrote that song  years ago
you wrote it
yeah back when i used to be in the rock business and now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs
wow then you should get money for it
aww i don't want any money i just like to see my name on the credits that's all
then we should go to the record company my dad's a lawyer dude he tells me about this stuff all the time
well all right maybe i will go ill play them my version of the song
stinky britches you got those stinky britches
so you see mr big record producer  stinky britches was something i wrote several years ago
hmm i really so no resemblance between that song and stinky britches by our artist alanis morissette
huh
its the same goddamn song
now look im trying to be cool about this but you just can't rip people's music off it's against the law
i am above the law  mr chef im afraid you leave me no alternative were going to sue you
sue me you stole one of my songs and youre gonna sue me
yes i suggest you get a real good lawyer well have the best in the business
well get my dad to be chefs lawyer
yeah and hes jewish
stinky stinky britches stinky britches
mr twig is that you  mismr twig  aagghh mr twig no  who did this to you mr twig who
now just let me do all the talking chef were gonna bring these bastards down
right
this court is now in session who's representing the defense
i am your honor gerald broflovski
and representing the prosecution
i am your honor johnnie cochran
uhoh
why uhoh
chef that's johnnie cochran he's the guy who knocked o j off
uhoh
i need some help over here please help i think he's got thirddegree burns
give the child to me
is he going to be all right doctor
uhhh
is he going to live
it's a stick
dammit don't give me that medical jargon just tell me straight is he going to be okay
and so on this th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of theday johnnie cochran has appeared to defend capitalist records the question now is will cochran use his famous chewbacca defense
what's a chewbacca defense
i don't know
that's what cochran used in the o j simpson trial
goddamn  i hate that cochran guy if he was in front of me i'd be like hey you stupid son of a bitch you how how'd you like me to kick you in the nuts
i'm sure that would scare the hell out of him cartman
and so in summation ladies and gentlemen of the jury you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago you've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month i'd say it's pretty much an openandshut case make the right decision thank you  we've got 'em
mr johnnie cochran your closing arguments
ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote stinky britches ten years ago and they make a good case hell i almost felt pity myself but ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury i have one final thing i want you to consider  ladies and gentleman this is chewbacca  chewbacca is a wookie from the planet kashyyyk but chewbacca lives on the planet endor now think about that that does not make sense
dammit
what
hes using the chewbacca defense
why would a wookiee an foottall wookiee want to live on endor with a bunch of foottall ewoks that does not make sense but more important you have to ask yourself what does this have to do with this case nothing  ladies and gentlemen it has nothing to do with this case it does not make sense look at me i'm a lawyer defending a major record company and i'm talkin' about chewbacca does that make sense ladies and gentlemen i am not making any sense none of this makes sense and so you have to remember when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the emancipation proclamation does it make sense no ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury it does not make sense if chewbacca lives on endor you must acquit the defense rests
okay then
wow hes good
in a tearyeyed courtroom johnnie cochran has just finished his closing arguments and as anticipated he did use the chewbacca defense  whether or it worked is up to the jury to decide
how find you find the jury

oh then what the hell are we talking to you for come on guys  hi are you elton john
sir elton john i was knighted you know
we're trying to raise money for our school chef
we have chocolate nuggies and s'more crunchies
i'm sorry but i'm not a big candy bar fan
what
could you just buy a couple anyway our friend chef is really
chef you mean chefchef

boo
hey elton don't feel so down baby have some of my scottish haggis it'll cheer you up
thanks chef i just don't understand what my music is missing
look elton you are a great singer but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics
i really thought i had it this time with cheddar cheese girl
what you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you i know a guy named bernie taupin who's working at moth burger right now i'll give him a call
that's a great idea
and elton why don't you get yourself some new threads you know some slick glasses and shit
and so i got bernie to write my lyrics and if it wasn't for chef i would never have had a career in music
so will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out
yes of course i'll buy three crispy yum yums
three crispy yum yums
hey elton if i give you these lyrics will you write a song for my girlfriend wendy

oh well anyways here's our song
many colors in my homo rainbowdon't be afraid to let your colors shine
don't worry mr twig even though mr hat rescued me from prison i'm still going to stick with you
did you love him
it doesn't matter he left me
did you love him
yes
then run to him
but i feel like i'm making the wrong decision
love isn't a decision its a feeling if we could decide who we love it would be much simpler but much less magical
i'll never forget you mr twig thank you
and now ladies and gentlemen mr elton john whoo
thank you all for coming to help chef this is a song written by a very special little boy  i have no idea what his name is but who the hell cares anyway he wrote it for his girlfriend wake up wendy smell the coffee

ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client chef  i know he seems guilty but ladies and gentlemen this is chewbacca  now think about that for one minute that does not make sense why am i talkin' about chewbacca when a man's life is on the line  why i tell you why i don't know it doesn't make sense if chewbacca does not make sense you must acquit  here look at the monkey look at the silly monkey
chef how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song stinky britches

mrs mccormick i'm going to have to ask you to leave you've been drinking

that's the ninth return i've had this week what's wrong with it  ap let me guess it killed a bunch of people right
yeah dude
damn it  just like all the other returns
dude why is your store called the indian burial ground pet store
well there was an indian burial ground here before i bought it
so you just built your store on top of an indian burial ground
oh hell no first i dug up all the bodies pissed on 'em then buried them again upside down
why
why i don't know i was drunk
we think that when you did that you opened up a doorway to an evil parallel universe
well that certainly would explain a lot
like what
well like this  i've been wondering what the hell this was
hello mr marsh top of the evening to you  okay bye then
sharon
yyes hon
there's a policeman being held captive in our basement
yes hon i had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away
why'd you take his pants off  shsharon why'd you take his pants off
oh randy i just don't know what to do anymore
what is it
i just ughhhh i can't believe that aunt flo is gone that she won't be visiting me ever again
oh wuwell don't think of it as an end think of it as a new beginning now could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick
look pal this is very simple all i want to do is return this fish
i can't give you your money back
i don't care dude i just want this fish away from me
no i won't take it back
listen friend you can't sell people pets like this you have to have a sign that says warning these fish are from an evil parallel universe now it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people but by golly  you're gonna take this fish back
all right you win

all right kid you can come now let's go
stan i wanna talk to you about family
what
what
you see i had a family once at least i called them my family really they were nothin' but a gang of people i thought were my friends ah after we killed a bunch of people together i realized that my real family was who took care of me and who took the time to care about what i did
but they don't care about me they just want to punish me
if they don't care about you would they have driven nine hours to nebraska
i guess you're right uncle charlie thanks
now can we go
no howard you go ahead i've got something to say
oh weak
folks i apologize for this whole mess i'm going to surrender somebody show the police a white flag
marshmallow marshmallow  this is making me hungry for marshmallows  marshmallow

oh my god they killed the little orangecoat kid
you bastards
they're surrendering
okay grab a hold of him you're under arrest buddy
all right you spread 'em
you're going back to prison to rot manson
good i deserve to
what
i can never make it up to the families that i destroyed but at least i'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime  is an answer
stop that
you see i get it now i finally understand what the holidays are all about boys don't you see you can't let things get you down during the holidays because being happy is what the holidays are all about
charlie's right i'm not gonna let some fake mr hankey spoil my holidays
i've been such a bastard all these years and i finally understand and it it it feels great if i feel like i feel like i'm in my own christmas special you seeholidays are that special timewhen we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozyforget about being angry for a day remember how it felt to be a childopening presents on christmas mornin' that's the way that we should all feel nowso i say happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happyholidays
happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happyholidays
happy kwanzaa toofrom me to youhappy holidays you guys
happy holidays bob
happy holidays chief
come on manson you belong in jail
you're darn right i do
well i guess i'll be going mom and dad i hope you can forgive me
oh of course we forgive you son it was nice of you to pop in for the holidays
yes now watch that ass in prison son
i always do see ya eric thanks for all your help
see ya uncle howard  thanks for being such a great role model for me  piece of crap
i hope you can forgive me too mom
oh stanley let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home
really
sure we'll punish you after the holidays
hooray uh i mean wait what
and so manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell everything is back to normal and i guess the only thing left to say is god bless us everyone
and i guess that's what i've learned i'm sorry for what i did but that doesn't make up for it i deserve to be in jail all i hope is that i don't make mankind lose faith in itself yes there's murderers in the world there's rapists and thieves but those are the vast minority the majority of mankind is made up of caring people who try every day to do what they think is right and that's the spirit of the season what do you think guys
it sucks just like all your other books
well guh good night you guys happy holidays
shut up
what was that  what the
merry christmas charlie manson hark the herald angels singlory to the newborn kingpeace on earth and mercy mildgod and sinners reconciledjoyful all ye nations risejoin the triumph of the skieshark the herald angels sing
dude this is pretty fucked up right here

yeah that's fine
no it isn't it makes you very sad now apparently the school board thinks that i don't teach you anything about current events so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board
aawwww
current events in south park now i want you all to read a newspaper or better yet watch television and come up with something current in south park to do a report on
aawwww
now this'll be a group project so i'm going to place you all into groups of five let's see uh wendy bebe clyde pip and token  you'll be group  and group  will be stan kyle eric kenny aand and tweek
aaaghah heheh
oh not tweek
we don't wanna be in a group with tweek
there's nothing wrong with tweek i bet he'll do a great job in your group
i can't take that kind of pressure no sweet jesus plehehease
dude we can't work with this kid
yuhugh
that's what chad everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of medical center he thought who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels what does she know about medicine well that intern soon saved chad everett's brother with a kidney transplant so you see
no
well let me put it another way you have to give your oral report to the entire south park town committee tomorrow and if it doesn't kick ass and you make me look bad mr hat is gonna smack you bitches up
wagh
hello there customer
hello how are you today
great what can i get for you large coffee small coffee
i'm actually interested in something else i'm john postum from the harbucks coffee corporation
oh you're that corporate guy who's been calling
that's right how come you don't call me back all we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here
oh forget it my my store is not for sale
my company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer  this is a cramsonite briefcase all leather it has four compartments and a keyless lock interested
uh i don't think so my coffee shop is worth a lot to me
well all right  how about
the answer is still no mr postum you see when my father opened this store  years ago he cared about only one thing making a great cup of coffee  sure we may take a little longer to brew a cup and we may not call it fancy names but i guess we just care a little more  and that's why tweek coffee is still homebrewed from the finest beans we can muster yes tweek coffee is a simpler cup for a simpler america
well that's too bad we're just gonna have to open our harbucks right next door to you
but that could put me out of business
hey this is a capitalist country pal get used to it
hello mr tweek
hi officer barbrady
who was that
oh just some dong what can i get for you
the usual  ogh thanks see you tomorrow
byebye

uuurrnnn too much pressure
great a lot of help you are kid
the gnomes

we can do our report on the gnomes
what gnomes
the underpants gnomes the little guys that that come into your room late late at night and steal your underpants

dude that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard
yeah i've never seen any underpants gnomes
they come out at  in the morning most people aren't up then but i am i can't sleep ever
dude we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes mr garrison will fail us because you're making it up
no sleep at my house tonight i'll prove it to you
they want me to sell the store and it's so much money
some things are more important than money  the people of south park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day
i know but if they open a harbucks right next door we might go out of business they really have my balls in a vice grip
oh hello son how was your day

'kay maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on we have to present it to the entire south park town committee tomorrow
oh i've got one for you how about doing a report on how large corporations take over little familyowned businesses
richard
no i'm serious hon these boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining america you see i own a coffee shop and now a great big multimillion dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business which means i may have to shut down and sell my son tweek into slavery

they really have my balls in a salad shooter
we're already doing a paper on tweek's underpants gnomes
yeah
now tweek how many times do we have to tell you your underpants are missing because you lose them not because of underpants gnomes
uunnnnhh
come on you guys we better get to work
wuhokay but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject
honestly richard i don't see why you have to preach to some eightyear olds
actually honey i think those little tykes are just what we need i've got an idea
man this stuff is strong
kind of bitter
what if my parents go out of business uh what'll i do
don't worry about it

really well son you might have just saved the family business what do you have to say about that
i need coffee
i know how you boys feel  sometimes a hot cup of french roast amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day that smooth aroma and mild taste is what make tweek coffee  uh very special special like an arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew a light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt
dad

the metaphors man
oh sorry here you go
hey do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee
liike how do you mean

thank you mayor i don't wanna sound like a dickhole but i
mayor these boys want that harbucks coffee shut down right now
yeah
hyeah
well i can't just shut them down this is a free country
but they're ruining our city
look the best i can do is create a proposition we'll call it prop  the town can vote on it and if it passes we'll see what we can do
hooray
hooray
what do you say boys we're gonna pass a law
uh hooray
so i guess you wanna do some campaigning  you can do commercials and things like that and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town and obviously if more than  of the people even show up
wagh
and care enough to want harbucks out then they're out so good luck to you
didn't you see them
all right what's next
next is issue d missing underpants
is it cold in here
uh boys can i have a quick this and that with you boys i don't know who wrote that report but now that you've convinced everybody you'd better stick with it 'cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper and i actually do get fired then mr hat is gonna do horrible things to you  oh not that mr hat that's really horrible anyway good luck passing your new law boys
jesus man jesus what are we gonna do huh
jesus man jesus what are we gonna do huh
live it's the south park town hall meeting on public access tonight's topic prop
should harbucks be allowed to open a store in south park that's tonight's topic on my left five innocent starryeyed boys from middle america  on my right a big fat smelly corporate guy from new york
boo
hey i'm not fat or smelly
all right mr douchebag
postum
oh pardon me mr assface anyway let's hear your side of the argument
boo
my argument is simple this country's founded on free enterprise harbucks is an organization that
hhssssssss
an organization that prides itself on great coffee we simply want tuh oh to hell with you
okay uckafay now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young handsome lads  boys your thoughts  come on boys don't be shy what's your principal argument
uh
uh
this guy sucks ass
yeah yeah woo
great argument you win boys
what
that was close mr hat
what is the future of america is it the money we make  the quests we conquer  no it's children  so what do children have to say about prop
i don't like big corporations
i like small businesses
i believe in the familyowned enterprise
in my family it's a silly enterprise
aarrgghh
it's time to stop large corporations prop  is about children vote yes on prop  or else you hate children you don't hate children do you remember keep american business small or else  paid for by citizens for a fair and equal way to get harbucks coffee kicked out of town forever
well what do you think
wow it it's great
yes it is we'll put it on the air immediately
what do you think hon  hon what's the matter
i have a big problem with this
what do you mean
we are just using those boys for our benefit they have no idea what they're saying
but kids are great to get people on our side
you don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs i won't be a part of this anymore
honey all's fair in love and war  and coffee hon huhon
take your corporate coffee and go back to new york city
yeah
it's people like you who are ruining main street usa
that's right yeah
how many native americans did you slaughter to make that coffee huh
yeah
damn these people aren't buying any coffee i'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd
hey kids i'm camel joe and i love a fresh cup of coffee it's yum diddlyicious and it makes you feel super  i have a surprise for you the new kiddicino from harbucks more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte
no billy no coffee for you  you should be ashamed of yourself using cartoons to push caffeine on children
why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from lady
uh mr postum i'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee
oh and you don't your coffee tastes like threedayold moldy diarrhea
uh i'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow and if the law passes you're gonna be thrown out of town
what
at five o'clock the best coffee wins either your coffee or a fresh warm cup of tweek's coffee  like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age you can count on tweek's coffee to start your day
tomorrow for the prop  vote we'll set up ballot booths here  all right men we'll throw up the stage here before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes like uhhhh like
toto
like toto and then the harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak and then the town votes
uh boys you better get your asses to work
what now
they're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers and this time it has to last five minutes
oh god when is this gonna end
your dad really screwed us tweek
jesus dude i'm to blame for all this i'm to blame for everything
so what are we gonna say
why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time
'cause then they'll know we didn't write it dummy we have to be original
does anybody know anything about corporations
waagh
i think my mom is a corporation
yeah that makes sense
you guys sshhhh
well how about we just say corporates should be stopped
how do we stretch that into five minutes
they're taking my underpants

cartman will you just shut up and let him show us
follow me
i hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker
well it looks like harbucks will never make it in this town  all right boys that's it pack it up we're movin' out of town
aw but we just finished
i know but these folks obviously don't want us here
but what will become of us
oh quit being so melodramatic sanchez jesus christ
damn dude this place is huge
yeah it's almost as big as cartman's ass
no it isn't you guys
this is where all our work is done
so what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal
collecting underpants is just phase  phase  collect underpants
sooo what's phase
hey what's phase
phase  we collect underpants
yeah yeah yeah but what about phase
well phase  is profit get it
i don't get it
you seephase  collect underpants phase   phase  profit
oh i get it
no you don't fatass
do you guys know anything about corporations
you bet we do
us gnomes are geniuses at corporations
time to go to work work all nightse
jesus christ look out
oh my god they killed kenny
you bastards listen we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers
holy shit we've killed your friend
yeahyeahyeah look we've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed
christ we squished him like a bug
do you know anything about corporate takeovers
well we can explain that to you easily
yes for a price
what
you know
underpants
underpants
toto ladies and gentlemen
yeah toto whoo toto woo
all right and now before we all vote yes on prop  here to remind us why are the lovable innocent children
uh since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers we went and asked our friends the underpants gnomes and they told us all about big corporations
underpants gnomes
big corporations are good
what
what's this
good
because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup
even harbucks coffee started off as a small little business but because it made such great coffee and because they ran their business so well they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today and that is why we should all let harbucks stay
ogh
that's not what you said last time
uuuh well the truth is we didn't write that paper last time
you little turds you've ruined my life for the last time
these boys are absolutely right we've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause and it's wrong we're as low and despicable as rob reiner you keep protesting and complaining but did any of you ever even bother to taste harbucks coffee  harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best don't you think you should at least try it
hey this is pretty damn good
yeah it doesn't have that bland raw sewage taste that tweek's coffee has
hey hey that is good
it's a french roast
it's subtle and mild mild like that first splash of sun on an april  morning this coffee is coffee the way it should be
hehey no hard feelings tweek you know we still need someone to run this harbucks coffeehouse i'm sure it will make a lot of money
thank you mr postum but i think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery
aggghhh
just kidding son
i love you guys
as we steer our boat down  looking for these dangerous predators boy there's a king croc right here  he must be four meters   feet long at least  this croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off

wow cool
you guys there's a frozen ape man from the past down here send some more rope
really  hey there's a frozen guy down there
help me chip some of the ice away
hey you guys this is just like that one movie um john travolta and that french chick were doing it all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about greased lightning  you know that movie where sandra dee thinks she's all prissy and then they try and try to get an abortion but she doesn't have all the
cartman will you shut the hell up and get some more rope
aww screw you guys anyway
hey remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward
yeah sweet maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy
hooray
for what
where shall we bring it
i don't know we just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it
i think i'm going to name it gorak
no dude we have to name it steve
steve what the hell kind of caveman name is steve
it's my name and i found him
you didn't find him i found him
what are you talking about dude i fell down that abyss and there it was
you wouldn't even have noticed it if i hadn't pointed it out
kenny who found the ice man
well i think you guys should name it steve
i think we're almost there you guys
aalll right people the next order of business is a very serious matter we need to vote on whether south park should reinstate the death penalty or not all those in favor say yippee
yippee
wait what was that i missed the question yippee
all those opposed say nay
nay
screw you
ey screw you
huh excuse me
not now kids the town is having a very important debate on capital punishment
but we found a frozen ice man from the past
i found this frozen guy in the woods today
no i found this frozen guy in the woods today
what the hell is going on here
we came for our reward
yeah like the kid with the wallet
reward what reward
mayor i think the boys may have stumbled onto something here you see mayor frozen links are often found dinosaur eggs woolly mammoths this specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution if i can unfreeze the body and perform an autopsy i could learn much about this creature's people and its time
sure sure sure be my guest knock your socks off
thank you mayor oh and boys i i can't give you a reward for finding this creature but if you'd like i'll let you name him
really
sweet how about steve
steve it is
wait a minute his name is gorak
come on steve we've got work to do  unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work we'll have to use the most advanced methods available
this is very exciting he could be a neanderthal or an australopithecus from the paleolithic era  do you see that kevin these clothes are from eddie bauer i haven't seen anybody wear clothes from eddie bauer since   this is incredible think of all we can learn from this body all that it can teach us let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away
stand back people there's nothing to see here
what about the prehistoric ice man
oh yeah there is that
dr mephesto could you please tell us what's going on
ladies and gentlemen we still have a lot of work to do  but it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over  months  yes it's true although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes
fascinating news tonight from south park an ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice a team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied and studied the caveman was discovered by kyle broflovski who had this to say
well i fell down this ice cavern  and i saw this block of ice so i told my friend to throw a rope
the prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neopostjurassic era where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on waterston street
that's it kevin now we can begin the autopsy
ugh what's this
holy crap he's alive
that's impossible  do an ekg on him
my god he really is alive the ice must have preserved him
well quick do something
nono we've got to think this through  mayor this man has not been conscious for almost three years he won't understand what he sees he'll be frightened and confused
well you just can't let him die
perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time
oh my god it looks as if he's about to speak
what
what's he saying
is that english
what you're you're hungry
you're you're hungry
me friend friieend me friend maphesto mahphehsto
hawgh if we could understand what he's saying then maybe we could get some answers  if only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own a mind like a child
dude i wanted to call him gorak
gorak's a gay name
no it isn't
why are you being such a dick
i'm not being a dick you're being a dick
nuhuh
hello children dr mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man
i'll go
no i'll go i found him
damn i've never seen you guys fight like this
all right there's only one fair way to do this everyone stick out their potatoes  my mother and your mother were out hanging clothes my mother punched your mother in the nose what color blood came out
blue
b l o o uh oho spells blue and that means that you will go to the lab and help out mephesto and then we can all go home and watch murphy brown
steve you
steeve steeeve steeeve  oh good you're here
oh my god they revived gorak
you bastards
yes and i need you to communicate with him see if you can understand what he's saying
uh hi
what'd he say
he said hi
very interesting
what
he wants to know where he is
tell him tell him he's home
you're home
in the year
he's been frozen for the last  months
dude you've been frozen  months
and we found you
all right all right all
all right all right calm down
i think that's enough for today
good job dude you freaked him out
oh shut up assmaster you're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him
guess what you're not my best friend anymore cartman's my new best friend
sweet
oh yeah well you're not my best friend anymore either cartman is now my best friend
killer
fine
fine
fine
are you alphonse mephesto
the same
we understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from
that's right
we would like to  we would like to offer our services in your experiments
oh where are you gents from
we are from the university of america
well there's not a lot to see but come in  he's still not responding much to us the shock is still settling in  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat
habitat
yes kevin and i designed a habitat for steve to live in that is completely like his own world everything is oriented
amazing he looks so much like us
yes well kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us steve really is he came up with this drawing
dr mephesto we realize that scientific study is expensive we want to help you make this project more lucrative
how would we do that
it's easy
as you can see the ice man is listening to ace of base which was a very popular group during his era and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers
he doesn't look very happy in there
no he sure doesn't
i wasn't talking to you buttpipe i was talking to cartman
well i was talking to cartman too
damn i'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden
ah here we see the ice man trying to gain internet access on the computer the internet was still not very big in his time so the web frightens and confuses him  it's okay he can't hurt you  it's oneway glass he can't even see us  and now the ice man watches television
this grizzly bear has the strength of over ten morgan freemans i'm really pissing him off right now
wait this could be dangerous
how so
he's changing the channel something on the television could frighten and confuse him
and they've done it the atlanta falcons are going to the super bowl
you guys aren't being very nice to my creature
he's my creature
he's fine boys and we're learning so much from him
let him out dude he's scared
he would be more scared on the outside do you think this stuff freaks him out how do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now
but it isn't right
little boy sometimes what's right isn't as important as what's profitable
uh oh ow
oh my god they killed kenny
what i'm not talking to you
gorak  gorak gorak are you there
i don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this gorak i came to bust you out

what happened
i saw it from across the street he just caught on fire
okay people stand back give the little burnt boy some breathing room
i've heard about this this is spontaneous combustion but it usually only happens to fat people near open flames
is it contagious
am i going to spontaneously combust
i hope it doesn't happen to me
this is very scary
the people are panicking about spontaneous combustion that's why i've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon you are the best scientific mind south park has to offer
uuuh mayor i'm a geologist
right
well uh i don't study human biology i study the earth
look you're the only scientist that lives in this town you have to find an answer before more people combust you do that and you'll be the most beloved man in south park
randy randy randy randy
we love you randy
make love to me randy please
wow
marsh i'm not asking you i'm telling you find the cause of spontaneous combustion or else
or else what
exactly
dude he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on
yeah
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh there seems to be a lot more takething going on but there it is perhaps if more of you attended church on sundays  the lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy
oh here comes the guilt trip again
now let us pray  lord though we have lost neil smith to free agency and steve atwater to the jets still we hope our beloved broncos can bring home another super bowl championship and once again bathe in the glory of your light amen
amen
let's go
let's go
broncos
broncos
let's go broncos
broncos let's go
wow that was short
boys i haven't seen you in church lately
well i'm jewish
you're not too jewish to worship jesus are you
i guess not
good boys how would you like to perform the stations of the cross this friday night
the what
it's like a skit where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of jesus christ
hey resurrection that's what my dad needs

or else what
exactly
what
right
where's our bible
it's in the attic with the old lp's  boys did you notice anything uuuh strange about kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion ooh what did he spend his time doing
he didn't do anything he was always with his new girlfriend
new girlfriend
yeah he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her what does that have to do with his death
maybe nothing  maybe everything
well we're gonna go work on getting kyle's dad a nurection
yes yes of course i've got work to do  what
let's see jesus got crucified then he died then three days later he had his urection let's see there's fourteen stations of the cross now it says we can makes costumes out of sheets
this is gonna be fun
i'm gonna be jesus
you're too fat to be jesus
oh and like you're gonna do it jew
stan should be jesus
either i'm jesus or else screw you guys i'm going home
you're such a fat baby
well i guess you guys can do the stations of the cross by yourselves
all right all right you could be jesus you tubby crybaby
stick and stones may break my bones but i'm jesus and you aren't
all right all right let's try it again kenny was standing here stan kyle and cartman were walking around him  now walk  do you feel hot
damn it how come you're not combusting
another one another one combusted
no has she been doing anything odd
no she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house
boyfriend and they said kenny had a new girlfriend
no i think i might have it
well well well a lot of you came to church looks like we're a little nervous about this spontaneous combustion thing huh
yeah
well on this blessed friday let us give thanks for stuff and things  lord is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason i mean come on amen  and now some of our darling local children are going to perform the stations of the cross

station one jesus is condemned to death by pilate
die
ow you can do what you will but i am the lamb of god

oh peter weak peter lame but i'm jesus so i'll forgive you i guess
mayor

okay if you're right about this marsh you're going to be the most popular man in south park
randy randy randy randy
we love you randy
make love to me randy please
wow
shmuck
station eleven jesus is nailed to the cross
oh this has gone from weak to superweak things cannot get any more weak for me
then a crown of thorns was placed on jesus's head and jesus was all like thanks
well this sucks that i have to die but if i die everyone's sins will be forgiven  so i guess it's cool
and then jesus was lead away  to mount sinai where he dies and has a resurrurection three days later
hi mom
thank you boys blessed be the name of jesus
it's a great name isn't it
hey that went really well they really liked it
yeah i told you i'd be a sweet jesus you guys
aw man at least the real jesus didn't weigh  pounds
up your ass with broken glass
this spot looks good
yeah that looks pretty good
okay cool see you cartman
hey wait where the hell are you going
huh i don't know i'm going home i guess
yeah me too
well get me down from here
cartman how stupid are you didn't you read the bible we have to leave you up there until you die and then you come back to life in three days
what
yeah dummy you have to get a nurection
then i can give it to my dad
hey uh i don't wanna be jesus anymore don't leave me here you guys all right that does it screw you guys i'm going home  okay i'm getting pissed now  god
all right people scientist marsh and i have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion and we have finally come up with a solution mr marsh
the little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend it wasn't the girl that caused him to combust it was the fact that kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her  you see as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas  the methane gathers here in the bowel area  where it causes pressure normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart  should the gas not be expelled  the methane can build up and then ignite  leading to disaster  kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long
you mean all we have to do is fart and we won't explode
exactly
so from this day forward everyone in south park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes
randy randy randy randy
we love you randy
make love to me randy please
whoa dude my dad's famous
come on let's go see how cartman is doing with his uh urection
wow he died
now we just gotta wait for his urection and i can give it to my dad
hey there you guys are
cartman
you guys are in big trouble now get me down from here
how come you're not dead yet cartman
you guys i mean seriously get me down
look fatass after you die and get resurrurected you'll have all kinds of superpowers just like jesus
really
yeah so hurry up and die you piece of crap
when i get all my superpowers i'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet  dude superpowers are sweet
hi boys
hi mr mackey
have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust
we know how to fart mr mackey
well let me show you just to be sure m'kay  hmm come on be good now
jesus christ
sick dude
i had a steak wrapped with bacon last night
dude i think you pooed a lot
so you boys understand you have to do that regularly ohmkay

stan
that's not the topic tonight the topic is global warming
oh
do you have an opinion on global warming
uh it sucks ass
okay thank you caller well let's go to our first guest dr alphonse mephesto  thank you for coming you claim to know the cause of global warming in south park
i most certainly do the cause of global warming is  randy marsh  it was marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer we are all doomed to die
awww crap
go get him
we want answers
you've killed us all
someone's got to pay
it's out of control
boy they're really pissed
well they're right we should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere
well let's go talk to them stick by me
hey
you killed us all
shove that nobel prize up your ass
oh my god what's going on
now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust ooor we let our farts out and kill our entire planet well i for one am not farting anymore
uuuh i i'll try to find a solution
we don't want your solutions phony
give me that  yeah
damn you marsh get out of town
you fraud
mr garrison help me
i i do not know you sir
up your
arrn
yeah take that
dude that's my dad
oh yeah sorry
the spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts  meanwhile the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion as we all know the cause for all of this is randy marsh the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist we caught up with mr marsh earlier today and he had this to say
ii don't know what to say
what an asshole i hate that guy and so do you and now on to the weather it's fucking hot thanks to randy marsh son of a bitch
dude those people are pissed
i know huh
where's your dad
he's hiding down in the basement i i don't know what to do
well you have to help him just like i have to help my dad
still more up next from the heat wave caused by randy marsh a giant glacier is melting above south park and the entire town is doomed and now these messages
having a hard time with male potency  well i don't and i'm bob dole what's wrong with you christ i'm bob dole and i can get it up
are you a lawyer
yes
we want to sue randy marsh
why
he gave us skin cancer
yeah he put the hole in the ozone and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies look
what are you doing dad
stanley i think its best you live with kyle from now on his dad is better than me
no he's not he can't even get a nurection
hm really
dad you've got to work people are dying dad you've got to come up with a solution
not me i'm not a scientist i'm a hack even if i found a solution those people would still all hate me
well that doesn't matter i learned something from the stations of the cross
what
see at first jesus was all like why me and he was all pissed off and stuff but then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else so he stopped thinking about his own misery and did what had to be done right as jesus was dying  he raised his hand and said the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
you're right stanley you're absolutely right  hey that bible sounds like kind of a good book
it ain't bad you should try reading it sometime
dude that was star trek again
huh
the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few that was wrath of khan
uh well bible wrath of khan what's the difference
all right now let's get to work
i've been telling everybody that you're my girl cause i'm not one to be shy you don't have to go with me if you don't want to just tell everybody i'm your guy you and me girl it's foreversha la la la la laaai've been telling everybody that you're my girlcause i'm not one to be shy i've been telling everybody that you're my girlcause i'm not one to be shy you don't have to go with me if you don't want to justtell everybody i'm your guy you and me girl it's foreversha la la la la laaayou and me girl forever and everyou and me girl forever and everyou and me girl forever and ever

really great i don't have to worry about that anymore
helloo
look there he is
get him
uh please everyone
you're a dead man marsh
please just listen to me i think i found the answer
could i borrow one of your rocks
it's all about moderation if you never fart you combust but if you always fart you deplete the ozone so we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really really funny
huh
i know you all hate me but please for your own sake fart in moderation you can keep stoning me now if you want  ow
and so we salute randy marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all

what the hell does that mean
i don't know
hey you guys you guys i think i know precisely what it's saying it says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them
right
and then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck and then sing it back again
yeah
that's what that means
ohhoho

it's true i was
well when i started courting your mother there was this big muscular football player named quib who didn't take too kindly to me he wanted your mother all to himself and so one day he challenged me to a fight
well
well what honey

uh how long do you expect the fight to last
i uh
however long craig wants it to last  t'heh ub look make no mistake craig has been ready for this fight since day one he doesn't even view it as a challenge
he'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked
hup did you hear that it sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something
shut up fatass
don't call me fat you son of a bitch
wow tweek and craig really hate each other huh this should be a good fight
on your first date look at the man's shoes sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes  when he takes you out to dinner try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you if he only has one credit card beware  it means he doesn't spend a lot and worse yet it could be a debit card if he has more than four credit cards that's a little fishy  the perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is two
what if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer but is still getting his degree
dump that zero and get yourself a hero he could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats
when i have your guys' ten bucks i'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest bigscreen tv in the whole world
that's more than ten bucks you stupid fatass

the jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical

okay children let's take our seats we have something very important to discuss due to recent events around the country i've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school
about what
now does anybody know what sexual harassment means  yes eric
when you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind
no eric that's not what i'm talking about the school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools please welcome petey the sexual harassment panda
who lives in the east 'neath the willow treesexual harassment pandawho explains sexual harassment to you and mesexual harassment pandadon't say that don't touch theredon't be nasty says the silly bearhe's come to tell you what's right and wrongsexual harassment pandahi boys and girls
say hi to sexual harassment panda
hi sexual harassment panda
hababah
did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear that's sexual harassment that makes me a saaaaad panda
this is freaking me out dude
and when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear that makes me a very sad panda  now i'm going to pass out these booklets and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law
awgh
article  section  one panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance if said panda does make
ohh dude get me out of here
i think sexual harassment panda is cool
you would think that you little asssucker
what did you call me
an asssucker it means you suck ass you see an ass you suck it you're an asssucker
that does it i am suing you for sexual harassment
uhoh
what
you have sexually harassed me for the last time it says right here that now i can sue you and take all of your money
that's right he can
no you can't you little asssucker
oh you did it again you all heard him
the first party of the first panda may sue the secondparty panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda
this is cartman vs marsh case no  what is your complaint mr cartman
your honor my lawyer is just parking the car he should be here any second
dude he got a lawyer
sorry i'm late
dad
oh hi kyle
all right let's move this along shall we now eric cartman uh you claim that stan marsh sexually harassed you in school
th that is correct my honor
hoh whatever
he talked about having oral sex with my ass
i called you an asssucker
yes that was it i was suhso upset  i couldn't concentrate the rest of the day and the way his eyes kept looking at me slowly going up and down my body like he was undressing me with his eyes
what cartman you call people names all the time
as you can see your honor my client is too upset to continue
mr marsh what do you have to say
wwhat do you mean
i need to hear your defense
uh i'm eight
all right this seems pretty openandshut stan marsh under the new sexual harassment in schools law i am forced to find you guilty
huh
all right we did it
hooray
since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources it is the judgment of this court that  of stan marsh's belongings are to be handed over to eric cartman immediately
i have to give him half my stuff
sweet
let's see i want that clown criminy game  and that power jim doll  and let's see  do you really like this remotecontrolled truck
yeah dude that's my favorite toy
oh well i'll just take that then  and what about this is this one of your favorites
uh no i hate that toy
oh then you won't mind if i take it
damnit
here you go as your legal fee you can choose between the green choochoo or the squishy football
hm  you know eric i've been thinking uh
uhhuh that model airplane kit go on
uh you know the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools  perhaps we should sue them next
what but uh why should i sue the school
well because they're the ones that let this harassment go on and they have a lot more money i think we could get a lot more out of this than half of stan's belongings
interesting  ooo stan's asthma inhaler i want that
answer the question did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom
no i had no freakin' idea
mr garrison do you know the definition of sexual harassment
of course and so does mr hat we do not tolerate sexual harassment
you are the witness here mr garrison not mr hat
i'm sorry toots
did you or did you not hear my client being called an asssucker
yes
and you did nothing
well he is a little asssucker
mr garrison i will remind you that we are in court
okay baby i'm sorry
principal victoria were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school
well not any more than any other student
oh so you admit that harassment goes on
i don't know
you don't know you're the principal
i can't be around every second
so it does go on
all right all right i killed him i hit him over the head and i cut up the body i tried to burn him but it wouldn't burn oh the smell of it i put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge i had to do it  oh god
principal victoria was eric cartman called an asssucker yes or no
i believe so yes
that's sexual harassment
last i'd like to bring up my expert witness sexual harassment panda
who lives in the caves 'neath the willow treesexual harassment panda
expert witness did south park elementary allow sexual harassment to go on
well when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex that is sexual harassment
and who's to blame
i'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible
there you have it straight from the horse's mouth
panda
panpanda's mouth
after careful review it is the judgment of this court that south park elementary pays eric theodore cartman  million in damages
all right we did it eric
it's time to celebrate yeahit's time to celebrate yeah
that goes in the master bedroom  well kyle what do you think of your new house
it's big
yes it is big isn't it it is very big
dad if the school has to pay you and cartman  million where does that money come from
well kyle schools have lots of money you see we all pay taxes and part of that tax money goes to public schools and it's from that money that we got our  million
and you don't see a problem with that
no it's a very fragile system that nature has designed all things flow into each other
you're trying to confuse me now aren't you
sort of yeah
okay children there's a few changes being made here at school but lessons will go on as normal any questions  yes stan
where's our desks
right desks well a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits
you see cartman you see what this has done
all i know is i got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes i'm telling you guys suing people kicks ass
wow i wanna sue somebody
me too i wanna get a lawyer
yeah
woohoo
well let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork now i'm gonna write a sentence on the board and i want you to tell me the noun
aaggghhh
i know i know i'm sorry children but we can't afford chalk anymore i have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail anyway children in the sentence the ball is red
aagggghhh
kids are you tired of being harassed at school sick of being called a homo a fartypants a butt face then call me kyle's dad and i'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools
after a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth i knew i needed legal help kyle's dad helped me get a  million settlement and this bright new shiny bicycle thank you kyle's dad
kyle's dad got me  million and he can do it for you too just look at all these beautiful girls
so call me kyle's dad because it's not about money it's about wait what am i saying call me

hello sexual harassment cubswho lives in the caves 'neath the willow treesexual harassment panda
uh uh have a seat mr morris
who
uh ssexual harassment panda
oh all right
uhmmmmr morris we at the school board have been thinking and we've decided that perhaps a panda isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children
you see mr morris we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with sexual harassment  at all
i'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go
i'm a saaaaad panda
eric cartman it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed pip philip at school
no way

as sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state the mother of all trials is set to begin the sexual harassment case of everyone vs everyone begins tomorrow no matter what the outcome the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping  million representing the side of everyone is gerald broflovski the lawyer from south park who plans to make quite a commission representing the side of everyone else is gerald broflovski so whatever the outcome things look very bright for kyle's dad personally i think kyle's dad is just a whore taking advantage of everyone in town and  this just in newscaster kevin mccarty is being sued by kyle's dad for slander the newscaster has yet to be reached for comment wait

you'reyou're a worm that's that's cool that's cool
okay yyou are a panda but being sexual harassment panda isn't helping anyone right now you used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment but now you need to teach a new message a new massage that people will find useful again
what message
that people shouldn't sue each other all the time
you know you little cubs might just be right
yeah
okay
your honor i'd like to make my closing arguments
wait
hey it's sexual harassment panda
no he's a whole new panda now and he's got something to say
hello everyone i'm petey the don't sue people panda
don't sue people panda
hey we don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here
nuhow skeeter he ain't hurtin' nobody
listen to me when you sue somebody it hurts everyone you sue for money but where do you think that money comes from from the schools from taxes from the state from you  there's no such thing as free money when you sue somebody you take money away from parks and schools and charities and put it in your own pocket and that makes me a saaaaad panda
i'm a sad panda too
i'm a really sad panda i didn't know we were doing all that damage this is all that damn lawyer's fault
yeah let's sue the lawyer
yeah
no don't you see ththe panda's right boy what a great message he has when you sue people you just end up causing a lot of problems for society uhwell i've really learned something today all i could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and i didn't care about where the money came from well i'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools they're too vague and two easily corruptible thank you sexual harassment panda
don't sue people panda
yeah well whatever sooo let's not sue anyone again okay come on guys let's go get some ice cream
hooray
pandas love ice cream
well seeing as we have no lawyers i'm throwing the case out case dismissed
hey we don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here
god damnit skeeter shut the hell up
hello cubs i'm don't sue people panda with an important message for you lawsuits damage our society i know it's tempting to make money but just remember that money has to come from somewhere and usually it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people so until next time don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools goodbye now

well i don't know what our mission is do you know what our mission is little firstgrade kid
how should i know

what
well we hate to trouble you stan but would you mind terribly being bosley for us
what do i have to do
uh you just got you just gotta tell us what our mission is that's all that's all bosley does just give a mission and us angels will accomplish it
alright alright here's your mission in ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody you have to find me a way out of this room fast
oh that's a splendid mission
well what are we waitin' for we've gotta find a way out of this room by golly or else we're gonna get drowned come on angels
which angel am i again
oh boy it's nice to have a night out without the kids huh
yeah i know what you mean
i love havin' a family and all i just miss being able to party drinking and socializing and experimenting with all kinds of different things
well that's what being young is all about once you have a family and a career your experimenting days are over but tonight is the exception that's why i'm gonna smoke this cigar  only 'cause i've never smoked before

what the hell do you want
well we've completed our mission jill found a way upstairs
you did
air shaft
dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct and i reckon it's got to lead somewhere and and it's good 'cause uh 'cause now we won't drown
so bosley what's our next mission
we're going upstairs
upstairs uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for
because you stupid melvins they have rad food and desserts upstairs
hey did you see principal victoria in there she looks hot
she sure does i wouldn't mind takin' that home
ohoh yehah i'm sure your wife would love that
i wish that's the one thing i've always thought of experimenting with a threesome
with two girls or two guys
huh well two girls of course i mean with another guy you know that'd be
you you never have a homosexual fantasy not that i have
you haven't
no i mean well they say everybody has at some point don't they
well i never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy you know maybe just i don't know masturbate in front of another guy
yeah well that that's not really gay is it
no no uh i don't think so
well it is a night for experimenting
sure is
okay i'll start
this must be the place they've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there
code  we believe we have found the compound request immediate backup
okay so just what is going on here people
get down
what
it's just like we told you officer there's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts
are you sure
of course we're sure  we're the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms it's our job to know what these fanatics do
so what does the atf do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide
oh don't worry we won't let that happen even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them
what's the situation
apparently we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts
any luck talking to somebody in the house
we've tried calling but there's no answer i think we're gonna have to move in sir
alright johnson
sir
i'm sending you in watch your ass
yes sir
oh come on in join the party mkay  would you like a meteor mai tai
heeey i love mai tais
we did it great job angels
so what's our mission now huh bosley uh wha what do you want us to do now i wonder
alright angels uh your next job is to get bosley some cookies and a tv set
what kind of cookies do you want bosley
i don't care just hurry
well hooray
so uh well that was certainly interesting
yeah
uh you don't regret doing it now do you
no no wuh what's there to regret right i mean all we did was watch each other masturbate that's that's not gay or anything we said so right
thuh that's right it's just harmless experimenting
well let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing
hey  nothing changes between us right i mean we're still friends
um yeah yeah sure sure
damn it where is johnson
no communication sir it doesn't look good for him
those bastards
great party mr mackey thank you so much
well are you sure you have to leave so early
we both have to be up early tomorrow but thanks again
mkay drive carefully mkay
hold it right there whatever it is you are intending to do do not do it  your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan
what
do not move or we will be forced to shoot  god damn it who was that  did you see them move
i did
yah
yeah they moved alright
well i tell you what we may not have elway this year but brister won every game he started in last year
eh that's true but elway was the heart of the team who's the leader now
i think the jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the afc
yeah hey uh if you watch another guy masturbate does that make you gay
what
well i just i have this buddy uh he sat and watched another guy play with himself
well let's go kick his ass
yeah
where is he
oh he he lives in like florida
aw
hey randy what are you doing
nothing uh i'm gonna go get some chips
can i come with you
okay
come right on in here bosley huhwell it was my idea  uh i got to thinkin' wuh where do people keep tv sets and then i remembered that lots of grownups have tv's ih in their bedrooms so so i walked into mr mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough here it was
rad
okay bosley we got you cookies and a tv set so what's our next mission
there are no more missions i have everything i want
wwe ain't got no more missions uhwhawhat are we supposed to do we're angels whawhat do angels do without a mission
just play something else god
oh dear we've angered bosley
tom i'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts
whoa cool
i wanna be a reporter someday
just moments ago a couple emerged from the house  according to the atf the couple refused to cooperate then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone the atf had no choice but to shoot the insane couple and now a standoff has ensued
oh looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits
the atf commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all there are choppers here along with several tanks  the commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside
wait a minute  oh my god  dude that's this house they think our parents are the religious cult
do you think someday i can be a reporter
we just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house  showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside those sick cult fanatic bastards
dude
hey uhour parents aren't religious fantastics why we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake don't we
yes come on angels looks like we have a new mission
randy you're making me feel unimportant talk talk damn you
i'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub
so so now we can't be friends
i didn't say that i mean i don't know i i just feel so strange i know it's ridiculous but i can't help feeling like people here know you know like even though nobody could know 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody
we said we'd never tell anybody
well of course we wouldn't
oh uh i didn't realize that
yuh you didn't tell anybody did you
well uh uh a few people yeah
what why the hell would you do that
you didn't say not to tell anyone
well of course i thought it would be implied when you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody
listen to you you're yelling at me you've never yelled at me before
aaaw
hey you guys we've got a big problem  the atf is outside and they think you're all a religious cult you've gotta go talk to them
huh how come they're actin' that way stan huh uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such
mom go look outside
mommy's little boopiekins
uh let me handle this stan  uh now llisten up and listen good everyone why i'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves uh if you don't get outside right now and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics there's why there's gonna be heck to pay uh heck i tell ya
come on we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves
lay down your weapons
we don't have any weapons
go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded tell them to come out peacefully and we will not shoot them
whoa
get back inside
i don't think they're gonna come out use the ganz technique
what's the ganz technique
this is what we did in waco  play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out  nobody can stand this much cher this is her new album if this doesn't drive them out nothing will
that's great music mr mackey what is that
uh this is cher this is her new album
well hell turn it up
yeah well you know what i heard i i heard that he's gay
oh is he
who
huh
who who did you hear is is gay
ricky martin the singer
oh
hey randy what's up
what the hell is that supposed to mean
huh
sshshouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now
wulluh uh i just felt like talkin' to you
there's nothing to talk about
you're having regrets aren't you
no i i don't know
hey talk to me
no
i thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship
will you stop it i don't i just
hey mr withdrawn you might not need to talk about it but i sure do
aaww  sharon  sharon cuh can we go
go the meteor shower hasn't even started yet
uh i know but i want to make love to you right now i have to make love to you right now
randy relax we don't ever get to party now come on loosen up experiment

get a hold of yourself man
how come you slapped my face stan huh why uhwhy on earth would you do that anyways
come on we have to find out what's happening
i'm standing now with danny ganz the commander of the atf commander what is the latest
we have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house they are refusing to come out and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts which should be any moment now
see how reporters get to wear those cool jackets that's why i wanna be a reporter
so what are your plans commander
right now our plan is to burn the house down if we set it on fire they'll have no choice but to come out
oh dear god they're gonna set us on fire uhoh great jesus son of mary wife of joseph what are we gonna do huh huhoh sweet joseph husband of mary but not father of sweet jesus
sh
setting them on fire seems a little dangerous commander
it is but we can't let them kill themselves
we have to let them know that this isn't a cult party
but we can't they'll just shoot at us again
uhuh they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened oh sweet jesus mary mother of jesus wife of joseph father to mary well wait mary wife uh oh hold on
come on angels we've got a new mission and this time it's for real
for hours now the atf has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house the meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment and so time is running out
hoh look harold's doing it again hm huh hnmkay
this is jill munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party  as you can see this is a perfectly normal party nobody is killing themselves we tried to tell atf people but they shot at us  anything else
tell them not to burn us down
oh yeah don't burn us please jill munroe gfn news
now what do we do
now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters
hey i'm a real reporter
you're right you are dougie you did an awesome job
attention cult people do not commit mass suicide there are so many reasons not to kill yourselves flowers for instance and back rubs  alright i'm through trying to reason with them send in the negotiator
excuse me but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics
we know what we're doing we did this all before in waco
uh yes but you totally screwed up waco you killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves
look you see this you see this
yes
you see it you see it go get it  go get it  alright let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass
having a good time
yeah swell could i just have a few minutes alone
i'm not gonna let you change on me randy just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub i won't let it change our friend
we did not share an intimate moment okay that makes it sound gay
good night everyone

there angels i must say i think we did a smashing job
uh we we sure did why we put the fear of god in those atf sons of guns i can tell ya
but you know i learned something today i used to call you guys melvins but you're just kids like me we separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard but we've proven tonight that we can all get along
uh so you mean we can stay friends stan wouldn't that be swell huh
dude i'm glad to see you you would not believe the night i had
you you think you had a bad night i had to hang out all night with these friggin' melvins
hoh dude weak
super weak
come on i'll tell you all about what happened to me
hold still ike we have to get you dressed where the heck is kyle
i don't know come on kyle you're gonna be late for jew scouts
kyle
i'm coming ma
go get the door kyle
get ready answer the door jesus christ make up your friggin' mind
oh hey kenny
kyle i'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower do you wanna come and see it with me
i can't watch the meteor shower with you kenny i have to go to jewbilee
what's that
it's what we do in jew scouts usually we just sit around and make stuff but tonight because there's a meteor shower we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods it's gonna suck ass i'm sure
oh that's alright
hey maybe you can come with me then it won't suck so hard
really
mom can kenny go to jewbilee with me
uhwell kyle jewbilee is sort of a special thing
oh kenny isn't special
aw
no no you're very special kenny it's just that well jewbilee is for jewish kids
you see boys jew scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different jewish denominations from the orthodox jews from the hasidic jews from the northern italy cave jews but you have to believe the basic tenets of judaism to be a scout
kenny'll believe whatever you want him to
yeah
kyle eh the problem is
please ma i don't think kenny has anywhere else to be tonight
oh all right just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't jewish okay
woohoo
come on ike  it's time to go to squirts
squirts
you have to be in squirts if you're too young to be a jew scout
oh
don't worry kenny i'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there
and then kenny abraham's wife bore him no children she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarai said unto abraham behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go into my maid
uh huh
abraham begat isaac who the lord then said to kill but that was just a little silly trick to see if abraham would do it
uh huh
eng jeck
no ike ma ike keeps taking off his squirt uniform
ike you behave
buwor
no ike
buh buh buh buh
i don't think ike wants to go to squirts
ike your brother kyle was in squirts and so was i you have to go so someday you can be a big brave jew scout
noo
tell ike how much fun squirts is kyle
what you want me to lie
yeah lie
oh ike squirts is so much fun
oh my god what is that
hey it's a bear
wow cool

oh enough already what has moses ever done for us
all sects of judaism follow the words of moses
not mine tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the new time heh we should use it to pray to haman and enter into a new millennium faith and it
enough elder you will not speak the name of haman here
all you ever do is worship moses but it says in the book of centuries that haman will one day lead the jews
we pray to moses here elder
if you guys love moses so much why don't you marry him
we accept all denominations of judaism here at scouts elder but your synagogue of antisemites is too strange get out and do not return you are no longer welcome here
fine  jewbilee is the time of haman you will all see how wrong you are very soon when haman returns from the ninth tower of disillusionment and smotes moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't having recently been turned into dust and all you will see you will see this very night
hello
come on kenny you have to get in the circle
what the fuck are we doing
this is where we all stand in a circle and pray to moses for guidance during jewbilee
uheheheheh that's stupid
it is not stupid kenny this is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it
alright jew scouts the meteor shower will start soon let's pray to moses for guidance  moses great leader on this blessed night of jewbilee we ask for your tutelage
may the teachings of moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively
o
stupid assholes moses ain't gonna teach them anything  do not fear haman this night shall be yours and the antisemitic jews will once again rule the earth

i don't know but i suddenly kinda wanna own them all
randy we can't allow our son to watch this stuff
well it's not like it's vulgar or violent

joining me now is father maxi from the south park church father what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks
halloween is an abomination of god a celebration of the occulteh
yeah and how about korn playing the big concert tomorrow pretty exciting huh
korn is a devilworshiping group that plays violent music if we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays we may incur the full wrath of evil
alriight we'll see you tomorrow for halloween in the meantime  here's a kozy hit by barry manilow
come on you guys think how can we scare the fifth graders it has to be something reeaally scary
we could get a big scary plastic spider and dangle it in front of them on a string s spooky spider that's pretty scary
that's not scary fatass
well come on we can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts
darrrr
are you sure we're goin' the right way

mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now
oh come on kenny you never have a sweet costume you're not gonna win the costume contest
yes i am i've got the costume it's waiting in the house yesterday i got this huge package in the mail and it was big okay
hold on kids
mrs broflovski
yes
we're from mt peaceful cemetery could we have a word with you
eehh sure come in  what is it
ms broflovski somebody has defiled your mother's grave
defiled how
well i'm afraid that somebody dug her up
dug her up why
well the most likely reason is that somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body
yeahp
what
uhuh we don't want to upset you but it happens somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak
every vile position every disrespectful act imaginable
hoh dear god
yes by now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well
oooh
no we don't want to upset you but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it
oooooh
yes and now for the difficult part
brace yourself
it is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh leaving her to look something like  an overloved hunk of swiss cheese she probably
okay okay i get the point just tell me what you're gonna do about it
do
oh we don't do anything we're just the watchmen
yeah i guess maybe you might wanna call the police or something
ooogh
now he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place so as not to allow further decomposition
package delivery for mrs cartman
a package oh really well i think i can sign for that
sign heah and heah and heah
i got a christmas present i got a christmas present  maybe i can see what it is i'll just open one little corner  let's see here  that's good i'll rewrap it later  oh sweet lifesized blowup antonio banderas love doll with realistic genitalia  oh this kicks ass what a cool christmas present my mom got

okay people i know we all want to get down to the docks for the halloween haunt but first we just need to inform you about thee people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them gentlemen
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen a person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac so that you all know what to expect my partner alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like
eeoooh
yes we know it's horrible it's probably best you not look at it now alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like
awwwgh
excuse me how is this helping
that's it folks now we can all go to the docks and enjoy the halloween haunt

well that does it somethin' funny is going on here your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts
they're not pirate ghosts jonathan they're ghost pirates
huh
pirate ghost would suggest that a pirate died and became a ghost but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate
no david then they are pirate ghosts because they're the ghosts of pirates
you're wrong because there were no pirates in colorado so these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact
but that makes them pirate ghosts
no it makes them ghost pirates
pirate ghosts
guys guys guys fighting isn't gonna solve anything don't you see this is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do
pirate ghosts
then you'll help us
sure we'll help you if there's one thing we like more than playing music it's solvin' a groovy mystery
alright
is everybody okay
people stealing bodies to have sex with them pirate ghosts destroying the town when did everything go so wrong
i hate to say it but i think priest maxi was right this is what we get for celebrating halloween and allowing that band korn to come play
he's right nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil korn band showed up
well i say we go find them and kick their devilworshiping butts out of town
yeah
lynch mob
down with korn
so this is where you last saw your dead grandma
right
maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside
alright gang we have to split up and look for clues
how should we split up
i know let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life which they can overcome go this way  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way
okay
wow that was easy
here's their van here's their van
let's flip it over
yeah
okay people let's try to stay orderly the best way to do this is all get on one side and push it from the top
devil worshipers
yeah
come on they gotta be around here somewhere
this place gives me the creeps
say this looks like a clue  pirate lore of south park hmmm now why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates
whoa what was that
the noise came from in here stay close everybody
oh no i lost my glasses
what does this dead grandma look like
uh she was all like crunchy and crispy and stuff
hey i got an idea  we should set a groovy trap
good idea
how do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts
we need something that might catch their eye to use as bait i know your antonio banderas love doll
oh no this is my christmas present if anything happens to it my mom will know i opened it early
come on kid we all have to do our part even antonio
my glasses gotta be around here somewhere  is that you jonathan boy i'm glad to see you i lost my glasses
raaarrrgh
hey you got a cold jonathan
raarraarrgh
yeah that sounds like a groovy song man remember that one
fieldy what are you doing
oh i was talking to you jonathan hey wait a minute if you're over there then how could you be over here unless you're actually a
puhpuuhh pirate ghost
raaarrrgh
okay here's how the trap will work when the pirate ghosts walk in they should go right for antonio banderas  when they hit the superslippery floor they'll slide onto this mining cart which should travel down this path into the next room where the fish net will fall on them
wow cool
hey somebody's coming
aaaaah
we've got to hide
hey there's antonio banderas he'll help us  mr banderas
jonathan no
aaaah
oh no
aaaah
ow
hold on guys
alright korn time for you to get out of town
aarrrrgh
aaaaaah
korn is sending their demon minions upon us
aaaaaah
alright gang looks like we're gonna have to use our special korn powers  korn powers vitalize
munky
david
fieldy
head
jonathan
form of corn
alright great job gang
that didn't help at all
we know it's just cool to do
aarrrrgh
nibblet
nibblet
what the hell is that thing
you did it nibblet you trapped them
yeah and now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are  oh i guess they really were pirate ghosts
alright korn you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me
hehey look what nibblet sees
whoa
what the
father maxi
well what are you waiting for barbrady arrest that band
oh
no arrest him
huh
i think i've got this groovy mystery solved
well i must say i still don't get this at all
it's simple priest maxi didn't want there to be a halloween so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks
yeah and then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts
then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese  aaaaraargh
and all he had to do then was create a ghost ship by using some candles a mirror and two squirrels
father why did you go to all this trouble
because halloween is an abomination of god i would do anything to stop this wretched unholy holiday
including killing people and wreaking havoc all over south park
don't you see that by trying to stop halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody
no
okay buddy you can explain downtown
well this is all fine and good but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body
yeah where's grandma
eeewww
there she is
oooh
hohoh
well thanks a lot korn you korn powers really came through for us
yes we were wrong about you will you please play for our halloween party
well sure why the heck not
all right
raarrrr
oh no the pirate ghosts are back
nibblet
uh oh
well this sure has been a wacky night but me and the gang learned a lot and we hope you did too you all perceived us to be mean evil people but really we're just normal guys and we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when actually they were just cotton swabs so i guess the lesson is it's easy to perceive somethin' someway and then be wrong so we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive
yeah
the gang and i wrote a song about it and it goes goes a little somethin' like thisand aone andatwo and a
boo
aaaah

hey my son is just discovering love maybe your daughter is too theyuh they need to know about that stuff

yeah
where are my children i'm taking them out of this godforsaken place
calm down pap  everything is all right  you see i've learned something today public schools may be a bit lacking in education but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills you can't teach a child social skills they have to learn them themselves and the only place to do that is on the playground in the cafeteria and so on  don't you see pap that's what happened to your daughter you tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual and now look at her she's a goddamned whore pap
well she sure is
i know letting your kids out into the world is scary i know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us but bad things will happen and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things

the south loses this battle cartman they lose the war
nuh uhn the south is gonna win
no they're not stupid
yes we are
how much do you wanna bet
now remember everybody for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the civil war so when the north wins all of us on the confederate side should act all bummed and depressed
come on cartman how much do you wanna bet the south doesn't win
well this war is about slavery so how about if the south wins you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month
and if the north wins you're our slave for a month
right
you're on
then i shall bid you good morning gentlemen and see you on the battlefield
hoohoo what a dumbass
yeah he doesn't even know that the south loses the civil war
it's gonna be rad having cartman be our slave
and with that let's all go to tamarack hill and put on a good show
yes woohoo yea
welcome to the south park reenactment of the battle of tamarack hill the men in gray are the confederacy from the south  in blue are the union from the north
it was a cold morning in  the union army had to get the bell of appomattox down from tamarack hill what ensued was a bloody battle but after many hours the union army prevailed here now is the reenactment of that great battle
forward
let's bring those confederate bastards down
fire

ow
yehhah
oh so this is what it was like
hey what's that guy doing
yippie long live the confederacy
huh wha
what the hell
he took the bell
he can't do that
the confederacy doesn't take the bell
hooray for the south
cartman you can't do that
god damnit now we have to start over
alrighty everyone  we're going to do the entire reenactment again because of some confusion over the bell now i know you're just trying to help eric but we have to let the union capture the bell this time
but why why should they get the bell
wuh well 'cause we're supposed to lose
but we don't have to lose
what
gentlemen we can win this battle  sure we could lose and tonight we can go back to our families and say we did it we lost like we were supposed to aren't we proud or or we take that hill we take that hill and when we stand tall upon it we hold our heads high and we yell not this year this year belongs to the confederaseh
by god he's right
jimbo
yeah i've been reenacting this war for  years now and for  years us confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the union reenactors well i'm sick of it
yeah why do we have to be their bitches every year
i'm tired of losing this battle
and i say it's high time we kicked some ass who's with me
yeah
yeah
alright folks sorry for the false start we're ready to go again it was a cold morning in  the union army had to

uh i can't be happy you ruined the reenactment
aw come on have a little sip
so you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet
you cheated cartman
yeah but it doesn't matter because the bet was that the south doesn't win the war and the south still didn't win the war dipshit
yeah too bad you're such a dumbass in history or you would have known that
i hate you guys so much so very very much and this is not over not by a long shot
all i'm saying is that is that the confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in topeka
that ain't true the confederates would have whupped ass in topeka too

throughout  the confederate authorities tried to drive out the union occupants of fort sumter peacefully but abraham lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the confederates so jefferson davis decided to take action
and the confederates won the fort

take the fort
charge

i've become a man i started puberty you guys
what
no you didn't
yes i really did
how do you know
well because yesterday i got my period
you got your what
my period you guys you see there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month
you're making that up  miss aliton what's it mean to get a period
well boys ahi don't think i can tell you ah
please it's important
well it's when puberty hits and you bleed you know down there
holy shit dude cartman's right

dude cartman can't hit puberty before us
well maybe we'll get ours soon too i'm gonna go and see if i'm bleeding out my ass
me too
in local news a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics  well it's just four days until new year's eve  the new millennium is almost upon us and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing singing and killing one another  but probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in south park colorado where people have gathered for a chance to see jesus christ craig netzel is standing by
thanks tom it is indeed four days until the new millennium and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking jesus here at his house in south park  everyone is giddy with anticipation for jesus to come out because as we all know if jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love  oh it looks like jesus might be coming out
oh look tommy there he is can you see him
he's neat mommy
everyone is quiet here tom looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous  but he has taken another step out tom this is great new for us

here
goddess moon goddess moon
dammit here
and i'm here goddess earthly delight so this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods we're supposed to talk about our periods and boys let's talk about boys first i think craig is pretty cool but i don't think clyde is very cool
i think clyde is kind of cool but craig is definitely cooler than clyde
yes i agree i think craig is a thousand times as cool as clyde there doesn't really seem to be a doubt
okay that settles that now let's talk about our periods kyle you first
oh ahah ahuhmm
what's the matter kyle
nothing um  my period is really uuuh  uuuh my period is going swimmingly
okay that makes sense mine is going swimmingly too
and mine too
phew
oh hello stan
hey chef
how's it going
bad
why bad
can i come in
well sure  now what's the matter little cracker
chef i have this friend see and this person is really bummed out because everyone else the same age has gotten their period and this person hasn't
ooh you're talkin' about your older sister shelly
no
your little girlfriend wendy
look it doesn't matter who it is the point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't
look stan do you really know what a period is
yeah cartman told us
stan let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle i think it might clear things up for you
okay
ooo baby yeah baby ooo babyyeah baby yeah baby now babyooo yeah yes yes babyyeahyeahyeah uhhuh baby nowagh agh awww no babyewww baby no noalright nowi'm alright i'mi'm cool it's okayuh alright watch out for the bedspread babylook out now it's alright i'll tell you whatuuh how about uuh uhwhy don't i call you next weekand that's my song about the menstrual cycle stan did that clear things up for you
so what you're saying is this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time
is that what i said
but it's not fair it's not fair that one day you're on top that you're the coolest kid in town and then the next day you're at the bottom again 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you and if i can't menstruate then by god i'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless yearold boy i'm gonna do something about it
whoa i musta missed a whole middle part there
i can't tell you how excited rod stewart is about this millennium concert he's gotten a little older but you're gonna see how much he can still rock
hoh i'm excited too i think it will bring my father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes for i an the lamb of god
yeah tand uh you know rod is a seasoned veteran so i'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash but we could talk about that later here comes rod now
hullooo
hey rod great to see you
oh
uh the folks are sure glad you're playing it's really given them a lot of faith in me again i'm sure that together we can make this millennium party the best new year's bash ever
pooped pants
what
pooped pants
poo pants
pooped 'nmuh pants
uh you pooped your pants
pooped in my pants
oh uhn nurse mr stewart has apparently pooped his pants
again  now mr stewart what did we say about trying to hold in mr dookie
yes puberty is a very wonderful thing stan it's what links us all together makes us one
but what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty
never went through puberty who never went through puberty
nnnobody i mean uh well mmy dad
your father never went through puberty
no and uh that's why he sent me here 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself
oh i can't say that i blame him
so do you know anything that can help him
well i should think the most logical solution would be hormones
hormones
yes  here and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week it could be just what he needs and be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me
thanks a lot dr mephesto you're the best
my pleasure i just love helping people
now for our first club activity we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word we look at the word and think about what that word means to us
okay today's word is spirituality what that means to me is uh
hey assholes
oh look it's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet
don't you worry about that i've started taking hormones
hormones
yeah they make you have your puberty quicker and i'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's
dude i don't think year olds are supposed to take hormones
yeah you shouldn't force your period stan you should let it come like the morning dew
so what are we gonna do for new year's
well we're going with our families to las vegas i guess there'll be some younger kids there too if you wanna go
aaaargh i'm gonna go take some more hormones
now the word is spirituality i believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she
ooooowwwwwwwhh
quiet kenny the goddess lives in all of us and has
oh ooowww
goddammit kenny shut the hell up
aaaaaa
whoa dude
mr and ms mccormick
yes
i'm sorry we couldn't save your son
oh my god my little kenny's gone i can't believe it
we just didn't get to him in time there's nothing we could do
what happened what killed him doctor
well we found a tampon stuck up your child's ass apparently he'd had it up there for several days it plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank
oh my god
my worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the backstreet boys doing it on tv or something
giih
we must get to the bottom of this if you'll pardon the pun but actually right now i've got to catch a plane to las vegas to see the rod stewart millennium show
rod stewart's gonna be in vegas
tom i'm here live in las vegas where tomorrow night the new year's eve event is going to happen jesus christ our lord and savior is presenting rod stewart the undisputed king of pop right here at this hotel behind me  it looks as though jesus really has come through  everyone is very excited because rumor has it that god himself is gonna show up to the event
what
how about you ma'am do you think god is gonna show up tomorrow night
of course he is this is jesus we're talking about he wouldn't let us down
oh no are you there god father will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow  hello
stanley  wake up honey it's time to leave for las vegas
whoooa duude i've got boobs
hey las vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people
alright people are we ready to rock the millennium  father in heaven please let tonight's show go well please make them like it
hey here comes stan
have i missed anything
wow stan you really got some nice titties there
did you get your period yet stan
no i didn't but
buh don't worry you'll get it someday come on kyle let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in las vegas
well i tell you one thing i sure as heck am excited we've got about four hours to the new year and so i think it's time to start it up ladies and gentlemen as promised mr rod do you think i'm sexy stewart
oooh  ooh  ooooh beehooor
whoa man
oh uh pooped 'em
this sucks balls
yeah
alright enough of this bring out god
yeah
oh no
we want god we want god we want god
please father do something
we want god
uh folks i'm afraid god can't make it tonight
we came all the way to las vegas for this
this is the worst new year's ever thanks a lot jesus
let's get him
well tom i'm here live in las vegas in what is quickly becoming known as the gayest party ever everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our lord and savior jesus christ
jesus why does god hate me
huh he doesn't hate you he hates me he's gonna let me be crucified again
he hates me more he doesn't answer my prayers i prayed to him every day and he never answered me
well yeah but just because god doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you
well then why didn't he give me what i wanted
well god can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want that takes all the living out of life
what do you mean
if god answered all our prayers there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves life is about problems and overcoming those problems  aand growing and learning from obstacles if god just fixed everything for us then there'd be no point in our existence  that's why he wouldn't show up to my new year's party
i just wanted my period
i get it now father i had to learn all this on my own  i was overcome with my new popularity and and i let pride get in the way of good judgment
whoa what is that
it's dad
god god is going to show himself
look i can see him
father you came
now look upon me my children and know me  be ye not afraid  blessed art thou my children
that's god
yea 'tis my father the creator he is the alpha and the omega  the beginning and the end
well yeah but that
what did you expect me to look like my son
well not like that
since it is the end of the first  years i will allow you my children to ask me one question
one question
only one
what should we ask him
we have to think carefully we can ask him anything we want like what's the meaning of life or why are we here
i have it i have the question  now you have to answer me once and for all how come i haven't gotten my period yet
my child you are a boy boys do not get periods that's only for girls your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection and your friend kyle simply lied about it
how do know that
you will hit puberty when the time is right but you will never have a period because you are a man  with titties thus spaketh the lord and now i return to heaven
hey wait that doesn't count as our question does it
i'll answer another on new year's eve in the year
did you hear that everybody i'm not even supposed to have my period that's why god wasn't answering me before  boy i'm sure everything worked out okay  i guess now we can all celebrate the new year huhshould auld acquaintance be forgotand never brought to mindshould auld acquaintance be forgotand auld lang synefor auld lang syne my dearfor auld lang syne
let's get him
let's have a cup oaaaa

about what
mother did you know that dad never sexually molested me
that that can't be
he never did mom not once
that's not true your father loved you often
he never did mom and i think you knew he never did
nohoho no if i knew i would have made him do it
you stood by and let it happen you saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep
i'm not listening
face it mother he never abused me
uh what's goin' on
mother won't hear the truth
he says you didn't molest him as a child
ahi didn't you knew i didn't
no i didn't know  i'm not listening
you can't close your eyes forever mother  mother wait
alright people how many people has a copy we must havea practiced the  song for the performance tomorrow please
okay children we need to play closer attention to the sheet music remember if you get lost just follow along with mr kenny g here
hey that's it kenny maybe kenny g can show us where  cents below the lowest eb is then we'll know the brown noise
yeah
anda one gop seven tosand   oooo stop stop  beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere that wasa terrify that wasa horribee what we gonna do
what the hell is that lady talking about
i have no idea
uh mr garrison sr
thuh that's me
uh my name is mr mackey i'm your school counselor m'kay
what can i do for ya
uhi wanna talk to you about your soni'm his ntherapist m'kay
uh brother look i didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger
eh you didn't
no he's upset because i didn't molest him
oh hm uh i guess that's a little different
a little yeah he thinks if i don't molest him it means i don't love him
well now uh what's he supposed to think mr garrison i mean uh look at all the media all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about sexual molestation m'kay he sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality
i didn't do it because it's wrong
i know i know but i'm afraid this problem has run very deep through mr garrison's mental state i'm worried that if you don't do something well it could kill him
hold on a second are you actually suggesting that i have sex with my year old son
there comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself how far will i go to save my son's life
well i won't have sex with him
well i've said all i can say  i know it's difficult but family is about compromises m'kay  don't lose your son over this mr garrison  don't lose your son m'kay
am i the only sane person left on earth
tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over  million children play my country 'tis of thee on their recorders  it is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history yoko ono has
well mom said i could sleep in the guest room tonight good night dad

that they should bring back chicago hope for another season totally
no that we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole new yorker kids
ooooh

they should bring back another season of chicago hope though seriously
ey what's the matter there garrison you look kinda sad
well i'm having some troubles at home
well come on tell us about it we always help each other out don't we fellas
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah
all right it's just that i mean we're all family men here right
sure
yeah we are
i am i know that
well can i ask you guys a difficult question
absolutely
of course
yeah man
come on garrison
alright would you have sex with your son to save his life
oh this is one of them scruples questions ain't it
nono i got a better one would you have sex with your mother to save your father's life
wooo yeah
oh like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said have sex with your mother or else i'll shoot him
yeah
oh that's a tough one
hmmm
no no wait uh you don't understand
how about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life
no no no way no
but if it was to save my mother's life uhi think i would have to have sex with my father
yeup
me too
well i think that goes without saying
weh actually i'm just talking about a son
well personally i would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life it depends uh how big a gun are we talkin' here
uh he doesn't have a gun
the father doesn't have a gun
no nobody's got a gun
i think if someone said have sex with your mother or else i'm gonna kill your son but he didn't have a gun i wouldn't do it
he could have a knife though
yeah
sure
yeah a knife
if a killer put a knife to my throat and said have sex with your father or else i'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you i would have sex with myself
yeah i would
that's right
uh huh
that makes sense
mmhm
wasn't that right
mm see
how do we write he note cartman
lowest eb let's see i think it looks like this
alright now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music and change it to the note cartman played  come on  there  that should do it
sweet i can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody you guys
okay let's get back to the room

alan i'm standing at ground zero here the damage is greater than anywhere  like the rest of the world everyone here has crapped their pants some  crapped themselves to death and still others ruined perfectly good pairs of pants a nation mourns and tries to rebuild but the big question that remains is how did this happen

that's not fair cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster
ey don't call me fat token
we want to use the sleds now butt pirates
sleds are for guys
yeah why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something
these are the school's sleds ass rammers not yours
look girls don't even know how to sled do something else
yeah
i bet we can sled ten times better than you doughnut punchers
oh yeah
yeah
we'd kick your girlie ass in sledding
how about a race down a real hill then
yeah
you got it
yeah
yeah
your best four sledders against our best four sledders
noo problem
then we'll see you this saturday on phil collins hill
phil collins hill on saturday you got it
see you there and may the best woman win turd burglars
oh boy we'll show them
yeah oooowhy us men will show those skanky hos who's who
yeah those girls don't realize what good sledders stan kyle and kenny are
yeah and with cartman's enormously fat ass the boys are sure to win
token i swear to god if you call me fat one more time  i'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock
fatass
there
oh
heh huh uhoh
and what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior young man m'kay
eric don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend
i'm sorry mom
don't apologize to us apologize to him
i'm sorry token
well i hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad eric
oh i sure do mr mackey i mean i feel really bad uhh what was i thinking  the only thing i can do now is try to go on and live day by day  see ya later
not this time eric you've got to learn to respect your little friends you're gonna have detention for two weeks
no way
yes way m'kay and that settles it now let's all go
counselor mackey
yes
i'm agent sharp and this is agent keen we're with  the fbi
we're here to investigate the rockthrowing incident
nnum m'kay uh i've already taken care of it eric cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention
i'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that mr school counseloryou see since the victim in this case is africanamerican this is considered  a hate crime
what the hell is a hate crime
uh oh but i don't think this is a ruh
new laws have been passed that make any crime based on race ethnicity or sexual orientation a federal offense
what a federal offense
oh no
oh no
we're sorry ms cartman but we must follow protocol  your son will be taken into custody and then tried in a federal court of law
oh my goodness
the hate crime trial of the century is underway  on court tv tracks u van  live here's your host leslie smith
what turns a normal fat little eightyearold boy into a vicious hatecrimecommitting racist we take you live to the courtroom  as the defendant takes the stand
mr cartman do you know a boy by the name of token
uh yes
who is token
he's a black kid that goes to my school
black  did you say black you called him black
he is black
o he said it again  he is africanamerican and so you decided to pick him out
i did
the rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate africanamericans
no i hate hippies
what
i hate hippies i mean the way they always talk about protectin' the earth and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets  i hate 'em i wanna kick 'em in the nuts
oo poopiekins
ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is why we have hatecrime laws this monster committed a crimenot against an individual but against a race do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison
ey don't call me fat asshole
the prosecution rests
don't forget we still have a sledding race this saturday pillow biters
we know
dude this is horrible we gotta get cartman out of court so we can go practice
eric cartman you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime for this i hereby sentence you to the alamosa juvenile hall until you turn twentyone
no
i am making an example of you to send a message out to people everywhere that if you want to hurt another human being you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are  court is adjourned
woohoo hooray
bailiffs escort this little bastard to juvenile hall
yes sir
alright you uhuhuh where'd he go
kenny kenny you have to get me out of town
what the fuck for
they're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime you have to take me to mexico
mexico why the heck do i have to take you all the way to mexico
calm down kenny
hey
do you still have that batterypowered toy truck you got last christmas
yes
well come on i don't have much time
a car chase is evolving on the  corridor east of south park hatecrime suspect eric cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's gogo action bronco our eye in the sky greg nimins is there live greg
tom it looks like the gogo action bronco is heading east on  police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway  tom it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off  he's going into a residential neighborhood now this is where it could get dangerous as there are pedestrians about
damnit kenny can't this thing go any faster
why don'tcha keep your head down
tom the police have set a roadblock right where the gogo action bronco is heading  this could be the final standoff
alright that's far enough stop the gogo action bronco and come out with your hands up  just bring it to a stop and come on out  jeezus he's gonna ram it  crazy son of a bitch
well it's been over thirteen hours now and still the car chase has not ended
what the hell are they doing
the chase has now moved through most of arizona and nears the mexican border
dude if kenny takes cartman to mexico how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on saturday
don't worry dude that little truck just runs on d batteries it's gonna run out of juice soon
we're gonna make it kenny we're gonna make it to mexico  oh god dammit
hello
just a friendly reminder cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race rump rangers
son of a bitch
here we are the end of the road alamosa maximum security juvenile hall
prisoner  arriving  forward prisoner you will wake up each morning at   lockdown is until  at ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband  at  we have naptime followed by fingerpainting your cellmate is romper stomper
huhwho's romper stomper
i am  and i don't want no new cellmate
you don't have a choice stomper now show this new prisoner the ropes
oh i will  you bet your ass i will
alright guys it looks like cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another  years so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on saturday
yeah cartman's weight was what gave us speed so we need to find the nextfattest kid besides cartman
come on who's the secondfattest kid in south park
uuhh i think clyde is the nextfattest uhkid
huh
yeah okay get over here clyde
i'm not fat
deal with it dude cartman's gone so now you're the fat kid
yeah fatass get your fat butt on the sled
hey i'm not fat you guys i'm just kind of bigboned
dah that's what they all say okay ready go
awwgh hey dude we don't even have enough weight to move
see you saturday poo sniffers
nice going fat boy
well well well new fish how about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms
yeah
uh 'cause i'm just like you guys uhi'm one of you
oh yeah the way i see it there's two kinds of kids in the world kids who like animaniacs and kids who don't like animaniacs you're either with us or you're against us so which are you
oh uh well personally i uhuhuhuh i don't like animaniacs
neither do we
oh thank you jesus  so we're friends now
no there's no friends in the big house you come in with nobody and you leave with nobody we don't believe in friends
yeah
yeah neither do i friends suck
now go find me some cigarettes and i'll tell you how to bust out of here
okay we've figured it out to add more weight to the sled we're gonna use these bricks  but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid
oh that's a wonderful idea
so i don't get to be on the team now
shut up fatass
yeah why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something you fat fuck
come on let's get it a try
woopee
yeah
woooooh
dude bail bail

nothing else is gonna work  we have to face the fact that without cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls
well uhi sure do hate to uh to see my gender tuh lose to a bunch o' women
this is a sad day for men everywhere
you know something guys i think we all took cartman's ass for granted

governor the free eric cartman now committee is here to see you
naw not another committee send them in  this is the free eric cartman now committee
yeah
well boys what can i do for you
okay go ahead and start
i don't start you start
oh uhyeah  hello mr governor and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hatecrime laws entitled hate crime laws a savage hypocrisy  yes over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws
if somebody kills somebody it's a crime but if someone kills somebody of a different color it's a hate crime
and we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy because all crimes are hate crimes if a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife is that not a hate crime
if a person vandalizes a government building is it not because of his hate for the government
and motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing
mayor it is time to stop splitting people into groups all hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites that homosexuals need to be treated differently from nonhomos that we aren't the same
but instead we should all be treated the same with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes  for in that way cartman can be freed from prison and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on thursday
that is our presentation an idea that we call
hate crime laws a savage hypocrisy
hm that made the most sense of any presentation i've heard in the last three years
hurry up they're sending the dogs after us  mph oowww
what's the matter
it's my leg i think it's broken  you go on ahead without me
uhokay
hey  you're supposed to say i'm not going without you or something
oh really
look kid you go on you've got something to live out there you've got friends
yeah i never really realized that until just now
i sure would have liked to have seen disneyland here i want you to have these
okay
no you're supposed to say i can't take these or something dumbass
oh i can't take these
take them they'll bring you luck  now go on get out of here
romper

you guys  oh god i don't even know how to tell you this
tell us what
you guys there's there's no tooth fairy you guys there i said it
what do you mean there's no tooth fairy
my mom has been giving me the money all this time and your parents are the ones who left you money
dude
that can't be my parents wouldn't lie to me
but now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt and we're poor like kenny  don't touch me kenny
you're wrong if my dad says something is real then it's real
kyle open your eyes man

oh my god you did lie to me
no kyle she's just makebelieve like peter pan

probably is atlantis real
probably not
wahahahah
look kyle adults make up those things because they're fun for children
fun for children fun for children look at me dad i don't even know what's real anymore weaaaah
man i can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy

you guys you guys i figured it out
what that your parents lied to you too
yeah but it's okay we can still get our sega dreamcast

i mean what if i'm just part of my parents' reality
come on kyle
what if this is all just somebody's dream
wow look at the size of these houses
totally dude cherry creek is the richest part of denver i'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  tooth fairy
hey  that house looks perfect there's obviously kids living there
there you can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got mega man stickers on it cartman once you're in the kid's room leave the tooth under the pillow then come back out we'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money then swing you back in the house to grab it
got it
this is the smartest business venture ever
what the
hey what the hell are you guys doing
we're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him
hey you can't do that
why not
because that's what we're doing
yeah you ripped off our idea
what the hell are you talking about we've been doing this for over two years
two years
nice tooth fairy costume you think anybody'd believe you in that
it's better than your dress you look like a bad jennifer lopez nightmare
how dare you
look this is our turf you'd better scram before the boss breaks your legs
you scram we were here first
what's going on  oh it's the tooth fairies
oh nice going now you woke him up
you woke him up
i don't have any loose teeth miss fairies but i have been a very good boy
shut up
alright that does it come on we're going to see the boss
who's the boss
loogie
my associates here tell me you were working cherry creek tonight is that true
uuh yeah
right on our turf boss i ain't ever seen that kind of disre  erp
we were there first
kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years  i do it just like my big brother before me and my oldest brother before that
damnit and we thought we were so original
let me ask you something you were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow then what
well uhwhat do you mean
how are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow
ha you guys don't even know how the tooth trade works
what's a tooth trade
look any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress the tooth racket is much more involved  we keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months  inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow but leave a note for mom and dad to see  this is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow  once the note is in place in the last house we start all over going back to the first house but this time all we have to do is collect money  and the kids never know what hit 'em
wow
the hardest part is getting teeth we tried various places cemeteries  hockey games  anywhere we can find them
nooo
the teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size color and quality  but there's never enough teeth never enough
amazing
man that is tits
and now my only problem is what do i do with you
rowwr
tell you what how would you like to run the south park tooth racket for me
oh uhi don't know
it's that or else i can cut off your penises
hm work for you have my penis cut off work for you have my penis cut off hm's see
cartman
how much do we get if we work for you
i'll cut you in at
two percent have my penis cut off  two percent
we're in
fellow dentists as you all know we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country there are also reports of missing tooth fairy money we believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this  a giant halfchickenhalfsquirrel  that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest  for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring we believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra  and that it
uh excuse me i think i have a more logical theory
yeah weh well by all means mr foley enlighten us
i think what we've got here is some kind of blackmarket tooth racket something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit
oh mr foley you realize how ridiculous that sounds
it's not ridiculous it's very possible i've seen it happen before
where
in montreal
and where pray is this montreal
look i know how to handle this all we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall you'll see i'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks
uhyubdub very well mr foley you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile we'll deal with the real problems at hand
well i will
anyway the halfchickenhalfsquirrel would most likely be about three to fourandahalf feet tall his large beak is probably detachable and works as a flotation device
here here over here look look what i got i got from the chef

it should be easy enough to find out they have tests for that kind of thing now m'kay
oolih oo livin' a lie timmehuh

wooo
we did it dude
listen to them they really love me  wooo
wooo
yes i'm a rocker
tonight we analyze the new rock sensation timmeo  the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm  already playing at several large venues this month  the band prepares for its biggest gig lolapalooblaza where they will open for phil collins but phil collins is not happy
well i thinks it's a horrible tragedy idn't it i mean people aren't gonna see timmy for his musical skills they're laughin' at 'im and i think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities
hah haha
society has to learn how to be more compassionate this is gonna stop if i have to stop it myself
dude did you see that stuff phil collins was saying about timmy
yeah what a dick timmy's five times more talented than he is
hey guys have you been takin' your ritalin
huh no we're not actually gonna take that stuff
no dude you gotta try it  it makes you feel good
good
hello there children
hello chef
hello chef
how's it goin'
very well thank you
very well thank you
everything's fine why
because we're on ritalin
what
we all have attention deficit disorder so we all started taking ritalin
it really takes the edge off man you should try it
so that's why all you children are acting so damned boring
that's correct chef
damnit children you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school in my day if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs
yes but now we don't have any homework so we can go see timmy play downtown at mile high stadium
oh boy oh boy
oh boy
oh it makes me sick those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects
but there are no side effects chef
no not at all
rown
did you guys see that
see what
you're watching mtv the cool brainwashing twelveyearoldandyounger station that hides behind a slick image we're so cool that we decide what's cool and now mtv news the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country which is cool here's your host kurt loder
why am i still doing this i've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least  years
kurt loder didn't just say that no way he did just say it but just to be cool that's what makes him cool you think kurt loder is cool and now the news that's cool
well it's only two weeks until lalapalalababa and the headlining band has changed now headlining the event is timmy  the new hit sensation out of colorado this news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline lalapalabala phil collins
well i think the sad question is where are the parents in all this i mean that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited and they don't even seem to care
and so phil collins decided to travel to south park and personally pay timmy's parents a visit
well i mean why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him
richarrrrd
helennnn
'oodleahah
phil collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play lalapalablalala and vows to do everything in his power to stop it phil collins by the way divorced his wife via fax and then married a yearold i'm kurt loder and that's the news
okay children let's settle down  huhh i mean it i want quiet  my god mr hat these children are so boring on ritalin  huh ah alright children today we're gonna learn about human reproduction what do you think about that  vaginas and penises butt sex  well dammit eric don't you have some smartass thing to say

nuhnn the name of the band is timmy and the lords of the underworld
look i used to be in a band too genesis and all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back but then finally i went solo and that's when i started writing really great songs but look if you happen to be on the sidelines you know bein' more of a cheerleader than a player well then i guess you should stay on as timmy's shadow

hey open this damn door
can i help you
yes you can what the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children ritalin
well they've all been diagnosed with add that's attention deficit
i know what it is but now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet zandor
huh
all around the country you bastard doctors are giving children ritalin and for every one child that actually needs it you give it to  that don't
hey now don't tell us our business mr chef why we
you're damn right i'll tell you yo' business because you two have got your heads up your asses thanks to you we have children in our town that like phil collins
eh wuh what
that's right you've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a phil collins concert
mm my god what have we done
well if i had known phil collins uh my god
well how do we reverse the ritalin
we uh have to convince them not to take it but ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them
then we need an antidote
yes of course
uh what's the antidote for ritalin
i have some right here  it's a compound called ritalout
alright come on we've got to get the antidote to all the children quick
last night i went obubudiolast night i went bubudio

i think it's working
booooo
shut your filthy holes you little bastards
get off the stage phil collins we want timmy
yeah
you just wanna laugh at him
no  you see we learned something today yeah sure we laughed at timmy but what's wrong with laughter just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it timmy made us smile and playing made timmy smile so where was the harm in that the people that are wrong are the ones that think people like timmy should be protected and kept out of the public's eye the cool thing about timmy being in a band was that he was in your face and you had to deal with him whether you laughed or cried or felt nothing that's why timmy rules
yeah timmy timmy
timmy timmy timmy timmy
man it sucks not being part of lalapalabala
yeah
hey dudes

and the lords of the underworld
put me down you filthy bastards  awwww
timmiihh uluhlivin' a lie
aaah  dickens the imagery of cobblestone streets cragging london buildings and nutmegfilled yorkshire puddings  hello i'm a british person for years now the character pip has been featured prominently in the american show south park however many americans don't realize where pip came from he's the prowling little adorable englishman from charles dickens' timeless classic great expectations  and so tonight the makers of south park have agreed to take a break from their regular show and instead present the prestigious dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end indeed after watching this show you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd read the cliff notes themselves our story is set in england in the small town of dropachairupontopsnot  where a young blondhaired boy named pip was on his way to see his parents
'ello mom 'ello dad it certainly is nice to see you again  don't worry sister is still taking very good care of me she just loves to smack me in the face and tell me i'm worthless o we have such fun together  but it's getting dark mom and dad i'll see you again soon  waaah
wha' are you doin' 'ere you little whippersham
oh hello why you look like an escaped convict did we breakywakys out of prison  oh dear but you're shackled here let me help you
wha' are you doin' wit' those
i'm an apprentice blacksmith  there you are  and here's a sandwich you must be starving
here wwhy are you easy to help me
well it's not for me to judge you sir we are all the same  don't quite all smell the same i'm afraid
pip where 'ave you been
waaah  lovely day isn't it
what the hell's lovely about it  joe teach this boy some bloody cynicism
i don't know about that i just thought i'd keep to me blacksmithing  ey look i've made me a metal fire poker
a lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while i'm starvin' to death why don't you make us some bloody food to eat
alright look 'ere i made me a metal orange
stop your metal orange you bastard you never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's you me'alpoundin' fairy  and you why don't you ge' a job you're eight years old now
oh lookie heeah  i've gone and made a metal newspaper
shut up you silly lip what are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper
well for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find pip a job ohhh lookie here young man wanted for paid position
where
where
havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter will pay up to twenty quid a day
that's a lot of  moneyloney
you can keep a little girl company for  quid a day pip and old mrs havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town
well the very next day pip went to old ms havisham's house to inquire about the job  and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams
who are you
i've come to answer the want ad
is that so you smelly little bastard
what
this way you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge  this way you beefwitted shriveledup monkey's penis  up here you gamy mass of baby vomit  in here
eho after you miss
i'm not going in there you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine
who is that
i've come to answer the want ad ma'am
come closer look at me  does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over  years
oh no no you you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over  years quite a lot these days
i sometimes have sick fancies  and i have a fancy i should like to see someone play so play play
um
estella play with this boy
with him  but he's just a commoner
but you can break his heart
alright boy let us play
rightyo what are we going to play
we're going to play a little game called smack the blond boy in the head with a large log
oh yes my sister and i play that game at home all the time  who will go first
oh you stupid pathetic boy
what do you think of her
well uh i think she's very pretty
hmmm what else
i think she's rather insulting
hm you quite fancy her don't you come back again next week we shall play some more
that night pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get estella's beautiful face out of his mind
stop dreaming about me you slowwitted rectal belch
day after day pip visited estella sometimes they would play sometimes they would talk but every single day pip's love for estella grew
don't you wanna play anymore
boy do you still think i'm pretty
oho well yes miss
and do you still think i'm insulting
oh um not so much as before  ow
i hate you you're an oozing painful hemorrhoid that belches pus
oh dear
you may kiss me if you like  come let us walk in the daisy garden
oh what fun it is to splash about in the fountain  you there the prowling little boy i bet you can't jump on my back  go on then try and jump on my back
who is that
just another playmate hired to amuse me you didn't think you were the only one did you
oh i rather thought i was
oh you silly smalltesticled boy come let us walk through the rose garden
yes good she will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces
well what a spot poor pip was in he was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful estella and although she treated him like dirt or perhaps because she treated him like dirt pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day  oh bless him isn't he lovely  but isn't it sad because pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as estella could never love him for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice
and so you bang on this side and bang on that side and there you have it  your very own metal fuzzy dice
yes i see  hoh lovely
eeyyyy what's all this pip
joe do you know anything about girls
sure they're those things with vaginas in them
but do you know anything about them about how they work
oh i don't know about that i just like to keep to me blacksmithin'
do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith
oh d'ooooh no i don't think so pip  who could that be
joe the blacksmith
the same
i'm a lawyer from london in search of a young lad named pip
i'm pip sir
mr blacksmith i've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice
oh well uh pip's not for sale sir
i have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future anything he desires  do you still object
heaven forbid i should stand in the way of pip's future but
he will one day inherit a handsome property but the owner of that property wants him first to travel to london and learn to be a gentleman
that's great news
there's only one condition pip your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous
oho but it must be ms havisham
oh oh if you have any suspicion of who that person might be you are to keep it in your own breast understood
yes sir
then you will go to london in a week's time  here's  sterling well blacksmith you look stunned
i am sir
then i should take my leave  good evening gentlemen and we shall see you in london next week pip
goodbye sir
pip  a young gentleman of great expectations
you shall stay here with your roommate mr pocket he is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman i trust you see no problem with this
none sir
i should think not  on up then and prepare for school on the morrow
yes sir thank you sir
mr pip
mr pocket
pray come in
thank you kindly you do look rather familiar
as do you perhaps we've seen each other before as to our lodging it's not by any means splendid this is our sitting room  just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth  this is my little room  rather musty and this is your bedroom
my how lovely
oh what a gay time we shall have and i do mean gay as in festive not as in penetration of the bum oh but dear me i beg your pardon you're holding your bags all this time pray let me take them  i'm quite ashamed
oh it's quite alright  lord bless me why you're the pale young man i saw at ms havisham's house
why yes of course you're the prowling little boy boy what a smashing coincidence
perhaps but perhaps not ms havisham is very generous indeed
that old biddy oh i assure you i have nothing to do with her anymore she's absolutely mad
well what do you mean
well don't you know about ms havisham's melancholy past dear me it's quite a story and should be discussed over dinner come  right time for a smashing meal and the story of ms havisham
pocket may i ask you a favor i am desperately trying to become a gentleman for the love of a certain girl so will you please tell me if i do something wrong at the table
you'll do fine dear fellow just fine now on to ms havisham she was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat  and now i might mention pip that in london it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth
hoh dear i'm terribly sorry
not at all i'm sure  anyway ms havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady and soon a man came along which gets me to the cruel part of the story merely breaking off pip  to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler
sorry sorry
not at all i'm sure  so this man pursued ms havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her she passionately loved him back the marriage day was fixed the wedding dress was bought the wedding guests were all invited and finally the day came but not the groom  and i break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table
oh excuse me
not at all i'm sure so the groom never showed he simply wrote a letter a letter that ms havisham received  minutes before the wedding
at half nine the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house
but afterward she laid waste to the entire house as you have seen it and has never since looked upon the light of day and the story ends pip with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table
terribly sorry pocket
not at all i'm sure
and so pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman he was schooled in several languages he was taught fencing and marksmanship and he was shown how to dance and eat box and after it all after weeks and weeks of intense schooling pip was finally a fullfledged gentleman proud of himself pip decided to pay ms havisham a visit to thank her for her generosity and to see if he was indeed now good enough for estella
good evening ms havisham
come closer pip  my you're quite the gentleman now aren't you
thanks to you
perhaps estella's been off to school as well  she's become quite the lady would you like to see a picture of her
oh my she is even prettier than before
ohoh you love her don't you pip
i don't know i mean i think about her every day
do you know what love is pip it is blind devotion unquestioning selfhumiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it
righto
love her pip i developed her into what she is so that she might be loved
yes but where will i find her
there's a dance at the palace tomorrow night estella will be there go and seek her out and love her love her
thank you ms havisham for everything  i'm the happiest boy in the land
and if she warms to you love her she tears your heart into pieces and as you get older it will tear deeper  lover her
yes our young pip had come a long way from the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations and now he was to finally see his beloved estella again at a grand ball held by the king of england tony blair it was here that pip would finally and formally ask estella to be his girlfriend and all would be right with the world
hello estella
pip  my goodness how you've changed
yes i've become a gentleman may i
i suppose  so how is it that you've learned to dress and dance
well i was sent to be schooled in london
iiii see and you no longer live with the blacksmith
oh i see joe once in a while but i don't have much in common with him anymore now that i'm a gentleman and all
naturally
it is wonderful to see you again estella
is it why
because i believe i'm in love with you
pip you must know that i have no heart
i think you do
oh i have a heart to be shot or stabbed in no doubt and if it cease to beat i should cease to be but  you know what i mean i have no softness there no sympathy sentiment
i see past that estella i see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind
hey estella let's get out of here
alright steve just one moment
who who is that
that is steve he is seventeen and has a car
i see and you fancy this steve fellow
i should he's my boyfriend
boyfriend
what's the matter pip
i don't understand i did everything right i stopped being a poor commoner i even blew off my lovin' joe
it's it's the way it goes sometimes pip  he's seventeen and has a car i'm i'm very  i'm  leaving
ms havisham you have to talk to estella she's going out with a
well well well if it isn't mr pip
ms havisham but um
don't they make a handsome couple pip  look at the way he holds her hand
but i don't understand  you sent me away to become a gentleman so that i could be with estella
things aren't always as they seem pip  oh what's the matter did she break your heart
well i suppose that if you set out to break my heart you did a very good job of it because it certainly does hurt
yes tell me about the pain  tell me about the crushing and the prickly things
it's aas if sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly
yes and it is somewhat difficult to breathe
hey wait a second you mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom
is your heart broken as well tell me all about it
but why do you make your daughter hurt people
wuhhy well that's simple because i need the tears of brokenhearted men to use in my genesis device  you see my foolish child i'm growing very old but tonight i will fuse my soul into estella's once and for all and then i can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation
what the hell
estella prepare yourself for the genesis platform
oh no you don't you're my girl and i'm not lettin' you walk out on me  what the
and as for you pip my robot monkeys should take care of you
pip pip old chap
joe
that's right you're safe and warm now
joe found you lying face down in the street mr pip you were in such a state you've been unconscious here for nearly three hours
ms havisham she has all the men who have had their hearts broken by estella trapped in her house  oh why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman
well about that pip there's another person who wants to see you
allo pip you remember me
i'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse
why you're the escaped convict i helped a long time ago
yes after you helped me i moved to wales and made somethin' o' myself if it weren't for you i'd have never become a millionaire
'e's the one that sent you to london pip 'e's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman
you but why
because back then you treated me like any other person you're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man
oh dear all this time i thought it was ms havisham she totally let me believe it
i tried to tell you pip she's a vengeful spiteful woman who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex
well i've certainly learned a lot that being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance or proper table manners it means being a gentle man gentle to everyone
righto pip righto
and now i suppose there's only one thing left to do
what's that pip
if ms havisham is determined to do this to others let's go kick her arse
yeah
and now we come to the final act of the dickens classic tale in which the stage is set for an epic showdown ms havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe but pip is not about to let estella's soul be forever consumed by the genesis device and now the thrilling conclusion of great expectations
are you ready estella are you ready to complete the cycle
yes mother
not so fast you ugly ancient bitch
pip
your manhating days are over ms havisham
quite the contrary blacksmith my revenge on the male race is only about to begin
dear god pip look
estella help me i'm your boyfriend
so am i
and me
we were all estella's boyfriends at one time or another now we're doomed
yes cry away males  once your tears have collected into the genesis device the fusion of estella and me will be complete
you won't get away with this
won't i  let the transformation begin
pip she started the device
pocket get over there and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying
righto pip
it begins
come estella you can't want to be part of this
it is what i was raised for
aaaaaaa
hello gentlemen oh whatever you do please do not cry havisham's device fuels itself on your tears i'm afraid
how are we not to cry our hearts have been broken our lives ruined and now we are set to die
yes but just think about panda bears  oh they're so cuddly and sweet panda bears are  what silly little noses they have
panda bears make me sad they're almost extinct
oh right right let's not think about panda bears then let's think about swimming oh what jolly fun swimming is with a splishysplash and a holdyourbreath dive
yes
get out of that chair you old cow
estella listen to me you are a wonderful girl with a kind heart
i told you pip i have no heart
but you do and i shall prove it to you once and for all  look at this adorable little bunny
oh my 'e's very cute
you see that a heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny they'd just as soon break its neck  oh but look at this bunny  there you see that you have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies  right
oh what fun it is to collect stamps lick the backs put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors
my father died in a stampcollecting accident
right let's not talk about stampcollecting then let's talk about
iceskating
oh what fun iceskating is  who can catch me who can catch the iceskating king that's me
oy can't figh' 'em off no moh
nine nine baby bunnies a person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies so you do have too big a heart to  ten baby bunnies
there's too many of them
please sirs you must not cry
we can't help it you're bawlin' us to tears
philip it's too late
twentysix baby bunnies
i don't want to i don't see the point in this
what
i don't want to kill any more of them
there you see you do have a heart
you think so let me see it  maybe i can kill it
no no i'm sure of it you have a heart you've bought your own life come with me now
yessss  noooo
ooooo top smart pip
you did it pip
well i guess old ms havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes ey
yes her poor miserable life is finally over
you're released from her now estella now we can begin our life together
yes yes my smalltesticled love
oh i'm so glad everything has worked out  where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then pip
and they all lived happily ever after except for pocket who died of hepatitis b  so ends charles dickens' great expectations we hope you now have a deeper appreciation for pip and indeed  all masterpieces of literature like this one  until next time i'm a british person good night

we've been after you for a long time buddy do you know your rights
rights does anybody know their rights you see i've learned something today  our forefathers came to this country because they believed in an idea an idea called freedom they wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs where a person can live the way he chooses to live  you see us as being perverted because we're different from you people are afraid of us because they don't understand and sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand
dude you have sex with children
we are human most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys we were born that way we can't help the way we are and if you all can't understand that well then i guess you'll just have to put us away
dude you have sex with children
yeah you know we believe in equality for everybody and tolerance and all that gay stuff but dude fuck you
seriously
alright that's enough you're all going to be put away for a long time
well cartman

god this must be the fiftieth time this has happened
fiftysecond
good morning children mr garrison is away today i am your substitute teacher mr wyland
oh sweet dude substitute teacher
now i understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers  but if we all behave and respect each other i'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day let's start with roll call let's see mmmmm  eric cartman
here
alright and how about stan marsh
here
it's not that funny you guys jesus
okay and where iiiiss kenny mccormick
here  oh hoho ow
dude what the hell was that
oh huh oh geez you know when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose uh ho ho man
dude you weren't drinking any milk
huh
you have to be drinking milk for that to happen
not with me man
alright look why don't we skip roll call here's what we're gonna do today  i've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days  kyle broflovski
he's fakin'
well i've been told that in mr garrison's absence our activity for the day is to make a getwell card for kyle so i got this large piece of poster board and we're all gonna come up and use glitterand glue to decorate it
awww
he's fakin'
kenny you come and decorate the getwell card too
but i don't want kyle to get well i hate kyle
i don't care get down here and do it
hey watch it  hey what are you doin'
now that's a getwell card
mr garrison after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a hiatus from teaching indefinitely
what
frankly your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting
did you know that not one of your students knew who sam adams was
well who cares about a guy that makes beer jesus christ i'm trying to teach history
frankly mr garrison it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about  it's your somewhat substantial police record
oh whatever
mr garrison last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa
that was not me that was mr hat
all we're saying is perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little  child molestation thing dies down a bit
gentlemen teaching is all i know it is the air that i breathe
we're sorry mr garrison we have no choice
very well i guess i'm not a teacher anymore  i suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun
mr garrison most teachers do not carry a gun
oh sorry so i can keep it then
kyle stan and his mother came over to visit you
hello sweetie
dude you can stop faking now we got a substitute teacher  kyle
they say it's his kidneys kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down
well the kids at school made you a card kyle look
go on butters
ho i don't wanna
butters go on
oh uhuh alright then we're so sorry you're not feeling wellwe hope you're better soonso we're bringing you some sunshineby um singing you this tuneeverybody misses youand though we hate to cause a fusswe'd like to say get well soonand please don't die on us
dude you really are sick huh
i don't know i
i don't know what to do sharon they wanna have him go into surgery but they're so dangerous
sheila have you tried holistic natural medicines they work wonders i read all about in people
really in people
there's a brandnew shop in town that sells holistic medicines and allnatural foods it's run by this fascinating woman named miss information
oh well with a name like miss information she must know something
why don't we at least take kyle down there and see what she has to say
okay i'll get our coats
can i go now
i don't know what i'm goin' tuh do mackey teaching is all i know
okay well maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do
i've always wanted to write a novel
well there you go m'kay
but i never know what to write about
well that's easy write about what you know write about what you love what do you love most
besides teaching
yes
poontang
m m'kay
i can't help it i'm a womanizer sometimes i know but i just think that taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world
well that settles it mr garrison what you need to do is go write a great romance novel
yes that's it  i am going to write the great american romance novel
you see the reason our body is stale is because of toxins
toxins
all the horrible food we eatthe sodas and meats are filled with toxins and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up but all your son needs is a toxinflushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper
wow that's amazing miss information
you hear that kyle you don't need surgery after all
uh excuse me but what do these toxins look like
what
wuh have you ever actually seen a toxin
don't be a smartass stanley
mrs broflovski i would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney i have these excellent herbs from local native americans
ooo native americans now they know how to heal the body spiritually
out on the balcony when reginald kissed diana's lips her knees went weak slowly he pulled her top down exposing her soft unyielding breastsoh yeah now this is getting good just the sight of those breasts made reginald's penis very hardhis penis was of considerable size and now beads of sweat slowly ran down hispenis making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool it was a fantastic penis that seemed as strong as a horse's leg yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk what a grand grand penis diana's nipplesuh let's see  diana's nipples  oh writer's block writer's block hmmm crap i'm stuck  oh well maybe that's enough writing for today mr hat
oh my he looks terrible
yes poor little dear
good morning everyone
oh thanks for coming miss information kyle seems to be getting worse
huuuuuuuuuh  oh i don't agree he seems much better
really
what
yes his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday and his aura is lighter
oh that's great news
oh no
nono that's good those are the toxins flushing out of the system
ooooo
those aren't toxins that's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago
stanley what did i say about being a smartass
don't be a smartass
now don't be fooled as kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse but actually he is getting better
wow well i am on natural medicines if only i had known sooner
i agree yeah that's right
mr marsh is here to see you
alright send him in  oh stanley
hi doctor
how can i help you
well it's my friend kyle i think he's really really sick
he is really really sick stanley i was seeing him last week when he first got ill but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine
but i don't think it's working
alright stanley i'm going to be very honest with you your little friend kyle needs a kidney transplant or it is very possible that he will die
die but kyle's my best friend in the whole world

cartman you are so going to hell when you die
yes well until then i need about ten million dollars
ten million dollars

look um i know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure kyle but the doctor at the hospital told me it can't
well of course the doctor told you that because he wants to make money holistic medicine is about nature  twohundred and thirtythree dollars
everything's going to be fine stan we're bringing kyle in tomorrow to see the native americans personally
isn't it possible that these indians don't know what they're talking about
you watch your mouth stanley the native americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us
and that has something to do with their medicines because
enough stanley
nobody wants to listen kenny
i know
i don't know what else to do i mean he could die kenny and that means we'd never see him again
uh huh
i guess maybe i've always taken friends for granted like they'd always be there if a friend died i don't know what i'd do  well i'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die kenny go round up all the kids in town who want to help kyle round them up and meet me at the bus stop at  kyle's gonna live

chapter diana had never slept with another woman before but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized aboutoh yeah mr hat hot lesbo scene comin' upand as rebecca's naked body lay before her diana couldn't help but feel aroused  go on rebecca said softly touch me diana leaned down slowly and brushed rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips it felt good like a penis a soft but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch in rebecca's mind she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises they were all around her flopping all around and slapping her face it was as if she were in a redwood forest of penisesthey presented themselves tall and mighty all around her withmr hat what the hell are you doing  oh mr hat

mom do you ever have those heavy flow days
oh absolutely sweetheart everybody does
mom remember the movie the shining where the elevator doors are opening up
oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon
like what
well what's the most absorbent thing in the world
well cherokee hair i guess   but what does that have to do with me
because now there is all new natural cherokee hair tampons
a cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid other tampons also come up short but cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful each tampon is hand woven from over  strands of cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads
you were right mom all natural cherokee hair tampons really did the trick
and when you're done using them  they make a great toy for jessie  go get it boy

first and foremost mr garrison i would like to thank you for choosing harequin romance
yeahyeahyeah so did you read the book
uh yes mr garrison we did read your book
well what did you think
well uh frankly mr garrison nwe don't know if the harequin romance label is appropriate for you
ooohhh why not
mr garrison uh are you aware that the word penis occurs sixthousand and eightythree times in your novel
well i'm sure there's lots of naughty words it is a romance novel
nnnno i don't think that this book really qualifies as a romance novel
no
no no this is what we in the bookpublishing business like to call gay really really gay
what the hell are you talkin' about
it's just that the focus really seems to be on the male organs
well i thought it was mostly women that read these things
it is
well women want to read about dingdongs d'you think women care about the details of female anatomy hell no women wanna read about big powerful schlongs  look i've seen women read these things they skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis that's what they want so that's what i'm giving them
hmmm
there's nothing more i can do kenny i've tried everything to save kyle holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend
you never seem to care when i die

gentlemen i understand you are here to present both sides of an issue i wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that i can give you both the time and attention you deserve jimbo why don't you begin
mayor it's about the south park flag
oh jesus christ not this again
we cannot change the south park flag mayor
mayor as i've said before i find that flag to be racist and insensitive
chef i respect you very much but you have to understand that this has been the south park flag since some of our ancestors like my greatgrandfather founded this land
that flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites how can a black man not be bothered by it
ahalright chef i'll have my assistants hold up the flag  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it
you don't see anything wrong with that flag
chef what about the baseball team the cleveland indians huh should they change their name because it's racist
yeah
no because it's their history
look i have gone to every quiet protest i could i have written everyone i've put up signs but now i'm telling you  this flag will be changed
and i'm telling you it won't
oh boy
okay children in mr garrison's absence i would like to turn the class's attention to current issues some people think the south park flag should be changed while others believe that changing the flag is wrong i think this is a perfect subject for your debate club
aaaaah
i see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year  prochoice vs cartman progun control vs cartman aand people against the clubbing of baby seals vs cartman and apparently the winner of all your debates so far has been cartman
thaaat's riight
cartman doesn't always win he just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore
yeah
nahah i'm just a better debater than you guys
you don't even know what you're debating about half the time
yes i do
no you don't
oh yeah well screw you guys i'm going home
told ya
alright children well unlike mr garrison i want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams tomorrow you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on
this is about history kids  if you don't have respect for your past then you can never expect to bird  then you can never expect to have a future nowadays everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  politically correct well where does it end i mean people are gonna start sayin' that the denver broncos are offensive to horses and then we'll have to a squirrel  and then we'll have to change everything and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten but to really understand the south park's flag's importance you need to know about south park's history ned here's a big history buff and he can tell you the whole story ned
nnneh in  fourteen pioneers from the east coast traveled across the plains
uh that that's okay dude i think we got it
yeah we got it
you sure
yup
you boys go make me proud now and win that debate chris peterson  goddamnit we missed him again

well i've counted up all your secret ballots children and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay and half think the flag should be changed
how could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is
save it for the debate wendy now i'm going to assign the debate leaders who wants to lead the flag should stay the way it is team
me me me me
stan how could you be so insensitive
whoa dude i don't see anything wrong with that flag
yeah me neither
alright stan and kyle  you can both be the team leaders for the flag should stay the way it is team  now who wants to lead the flag should be changed team  okay wendy and eric can team up
nooo
alright children do your homework and let's get ready for a great debate
hello chef
my name isn't chef anymore children i've converted to islam
islam
from now on my name is  abdul mohammed jabar  rauf kareem ali  with everyone in town so insensitive about the flag i find it no longer fitting to use my slave name
well we need help with our debate club we have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed
you what  you don't think they should change the flag
not really
yeah we don't see what the big deal is
well that figures you don't because your crackerass parents turned you into little crackerass crackerracists i never thought i'd live to see this many of the people i considered friends turn against me
but chef we don't know what you're talking about
but nothin'  but my ass fix your own damn food
okay now in order for us the debate to change the south park flag we will need to do a lot of research now my plan is to divide up into three research teams we will present our arguments based on things that w
it's okay i'm here
nice of you to show up we were just discussing how we should state our case
yes this is a difficult case in order to win the debate we will need to attack stan and kyle's credibility
what
that's how you win these things attack your opponents' credibility  butters take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on kyle's past i'm talkin' booby magazines whatever
wwuhuhokay
the rest of you go get the goods on stan his mom grounded him once for setting something on fire let's find out what that something was and then lie and say it was a puppy
right
mmmm
cartman we can't just attack stan and kyle's credibility we need to present our side of the debate
you're right we'll need to look like we prepared a case too so that they look all the weaker good plan sooo what's the issue again
the south park flag
interesting aaand what side are we on
d'aaaaahhh
whoa calm down ho
tom i'm standing out front of the south park mayor's office where both sides of this debate have gathered

earlier the south park townspeople voiced their opinion
well i think the flag is racist  huh but then again it is part of our history

dugh  ogh waaaaah
how can you all just stand by and let these racists do this
well chef it's freedom of speech we don't like it but we can't arrest them for talking
should the klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the capitol here's what some people think
well i think they are racist but i do think freedom of speech is important
well i for one believe in freedom of speech mmm but then again i think they are racist
well i believe that they are racist but i do believe that all
aw the hell with all of you indecisive bastards
on friday south park elementary will present its debate and after the debate there will finally be a vote preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag three against changing the flag and  undecided z so the pressure in on those south park kids
well that's enough rallying for this afternoon members let's take a hot shower
hot shower hot shower hot shower
ned nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those kkk members are on come on we gotta put a stop to them
i can't believe it all the pressure's on us i mean this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote
uh huh
oh man we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument
why don't we just talk about the swastika
huh
i mean germany was united under the swastika right but obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff so hey changed it
hey that's a pretty good point cartman
yeah
not bad at all i may make that our first argument
cool
doublestuffed cookies are my favorite
really mine too what i really like to do is i like to take the tops off of two cookies and then put them together and make quadruple stuffs
hey that's what i always do too
no way
yeah jesus i never thought i'd have anything in common with you cartman
me neither
aha ha
huh
well anyway let's get back to work
whoa

white power white power
good evening brothers our first order of business tonight is to have brother anderson update us on last week's minutes
last week we decided we hate blacks and jews a lot
alright and now it's time for us all to come together and do our cake raffle
oh cake raffle
this week's winner is  uh
i won i won  i won the cake
god job brother
cartman
ahh
say it'll be like this forever
okay it will be like this forever
oh cartman
aaaaaaaaaah  brrrrr what's wrong with me  ahhh it's okay get a grip girl
wendih  wendih
aaaah
wendih look at me
oh god please don't let this be happening
alright brothers listen up  as you know this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag but lynching minorities is history so what are we gonna do about it
let's say that if they change the flag we'll burn down the capitol
yeah
let's say that if they change the flag we'll never leave this town
yeah
let's say they should change the flag
yeah  wah
uh what's that brother
i think we should switch sides
me too nnnthat's a good idea
look we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us right
yeah mhm
so whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose right
right yeah
so why don't we all say that we want the flag changed that way most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is
that's a great idea brother
yeah
alright it is decided we will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed so that they will all vote against us
hooray yeah
we're smart
that worked perfectly ned
well alright now that that's out of the way it is time to play whose got the silliest thing on under their robe
yeah woohoo
jesus ned these guys are completely nuts
mmyup
that is the most insane thing i've ever seen i can't believe those people are on our side i mean is our side that crazy  oh hello chef big debate tomorrow i guess  oh jesus the robes chef this isn't what it looks like you've gotta listen to us
i ain't gonna listen to nothin' this whole crackerass town can kiss my ass
ned i'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes
thanks for coming over bebe i have something to tell you
sure what
bebe i'm attracted to cartman
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i know
why would you tell me this why would you tell anyone this
because i don't know what to do i can't concentrate and if i can't concentrate then i can't win the debate tomorrow the whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job
alright look when two people work closely for a long time sometimes they feel what's called sexual tension sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with
you mean i should kiss him
kiss him and get it out of your system
oh god
well i certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club  i rrealize that many of you are torn by the issues as well so perhaps the children can shed some light on us we'll start with wendy testaburger on the flag should be changed team
the  the uh  aheh ahum  the the uh  ahhhhh  the first argument we  ah  let me start over  the uh  oh god could you all excuse me for a moment  mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee
oh
oh god
there now the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history as times change we hope to grow and as we grow our rules must change it is a natural part of evolution thank you
okay and kyle and stan's team your main point
our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone because killing has been around since the beginning of time all animals kill  and the animals that don't kill are stupid ones like cows and turtles and stuff so people should not be so upset about killing
whoa whoa whooaa you just missed the point entirely
huh
i'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed it's because it's racist
racist
children don't you even know what this argument is about that flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people
ooooooohhh
ooooooohhh
wwe really didn't see it that way
but that's a black man up there
yyeah but the color of someone's skin doesn't matter
well of course it matters when  oh my god wait a minute you children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people did you
no
why that is that is the most beautiful thing i have ever heard
what
what
don't you see all this time i thought these little crackers had turned racist when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with all they saw when they looked at that flag was five people
awww
awww
yeah
i'm sorry children i was wrong about you but i still the flag needs to be changed but now i realize that i almost let racism turn me into a racist
yeah you know uh i suddenly found myself on the side of klan members i've never had anything against blacks chef
oh i know you don't jimbo i've known you for almost ten years you're a good man
we've been way too divisive over this chef maybe we can come up with a compromise flagsomething that everybody can be happy with
i think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers

problem chef i have mmany problems
wellll if you uhhh come back in just a little bit eric i'll see if i can help you out
i just don't know what i'm gonna do  sometimes i wonder if god isn't toying with me
alright eric what's the matter
chef god told me i was to start a boy band and make  million dollars the problem is it isn't working i mean  i feel the music burning inside me but i just can't express it right you know
well eric i i think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing boy bands aren't about music boy bands are created by corporations to make money they're all based on the gomlich effect
what's the gomlich effect
the law of physics that states if one girl screams for something it will make other girls scream and then it grows exponentiously until all girls within a fivemile radius are screaming
so how do boy bands use that
all they do is make videos showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band once you get girls screaming you can't stop 'em they're crazy  uhuh except for lilian of course
thanks
you're welcome now go away
okay
aand a cucumber in the pants never hurt either
cucumber in the pants got it

let 'em be pissed off then
i don't understand just let me go do this one thing and i won't ever
no  nooo
dad what the hell is going on
i was i was  when my highschool men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sportinggoods store in denver  i was just one of fifteen members and i had no idea that a record producer was in the audience
kid can i talk to you
uh sure
heh you were really great up there too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town
ohh thanks
listen i'm putting together a rock group a vocal group called the ghetto avenue boys i think you would make a perfect member
what me do you like my singing that much
yeah i think your mustache is perfect how would you like to come to new york and start a singing career
oh my god i don't know i mean i still have another year of high school and i
hey look if you don't want it i'll keep looking
no wait i mean ahi'll think about it
i take it that means yes call me in the morning
and just like that i left everything i dropped out of high school
see ya
i said goodbye to my girlfriend
see ya
and i left my family
see ya
and suddenly there i was thrown into a group with four other young men who i didn't even know
take
you've got ityou know you've got itwhat you've got is it
it's obvious to me girl
the songs were terrible but believe it or not the country ate them up the next thing i knew we were the biggest thing in the world
shirl you've got itit is what you've got girlwhat you've got is it
now give it to me 'cause
i had everything a huge house  and all the women you can imagine  and then one day just as quick as it started
alright guys let's take it from the top
hey mr allens
heh woh uh rrandy
who are they
these are the avenue ghetto street boys my new boy band
but wwe're still selling records right
look kid you're just getting a little old to be in a boy band
i'm
get a life marsh  alright guys let's take it from the top
they said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio so they towed my car
see ya
the women all left
see ya
and they took back my house
ugh
see ya
the only thing i could do was come back to colorado and face everyone that i had abandoned
hey weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band the ghetto avenue boys
sure i remember you  you got it baby you got it baby
and so you see stanley i do know what i'm talking about
jesus christ i never knew
i didn't want you to know because now i'm a joke ever since then i've wished every single day that i could go back to that moment when i was offered the job and say no because all the fame and the money the women all it did was build me up so that i could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world  that is what being in a boy band is all about stanley  it's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops now we wander the earth in disarrayus new kids on the block the osmonds we're all the same and that is why you can't go to the mall

hello satan
saddam
did you miss me buttercup
no it can't be you're dead i killed you
yeah you killed me so where was i gonna go detroit
oh no  oh god no
a place of everlasting agony and pain hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept christ  children in this town have not been attending sunday school after mass and adults have not been coming to confession if this does not change i promise you you will be going to the black pit of satan's world  that is all peace be with you
well that was quite an uplifting sermon
yeah
mom wuh we're staying for sunday school
what
we have to go to sunday school so we don't burn
yeah i'll see ya later mom
oh now look at that they're scared to death
hell is a very real place mr and mrs marsh i'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire
come on guy just let me in so we can talk
i don't want to talk to you saddam this isn't what i need in my life right now
is that the movers satan
ah yeah yeah it's just the movers
oh well tell them i'm leavin' their check on the counter
okay chris
satan look i know our relationship wasn't perfect okay i know that i was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed but i've changed satan
oh why i haven't heard that one before
come on can't we just go out for a burrito  me gusta burrito mucho
i can't saddam i'm with chris now
who screw 'im he can't pound your ass like i can
goodbye saddam
wait wait i'm sorry heh but satan you can't deny what's between us  you can try but you know we belong together
my life is good now saddam chris treats me well you and i are through goodbye
hey come on guy give me a break
hello children i'm sister anne and i'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your first communion
are we gonna go to hell
well hopefully not that's why you're gonna need to receive communion
a and as long as we get this communion thing we're safe
what if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives
yeah what if we haven't
it doesn't matter because we are all born with original sin now let me explain how communion works  the priest will give you this round cracker  and he will say the body of christ and then you eat it
jesus was made of crackers
no
but crackers are his body
yes
what
in the book of mark jesus distributed bread and said eat this for it is my body
so wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers
nononono
uhwell uhwhat are we eatin' then
the body of christ
nonono i get it jesus wanted us to eat him but he didn't want us to be cannibals so he turned himself into crackers and then told people to eat him
no
no
huhi can't whistle if i eat too many crackers
look all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker you eat it okay
okay
and then you will drink a very small amount of wine for that is the blood of christ
aw come on now this is just getting silly
eric do you wanna go to hell
nno
then stop questioning me
but now we can have communion and not go to hell right
no because before you can take your first communion you have to have your first confession
confession
you'll be getting in the confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins so that god can forgive you you kids will all have to go to your first confession this tuesday so i want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins so that you can tell the priest everything
oh shit
those were some great pork chops satan
yeah
hey you  you've been actin' strange all night what's up
nothing why
well it's just that you've washed that same dish seven times now silly
oh huh sorry huhhuh
come on satan you know you can tell me anything what's up
well chris saddam showed up today
oh  woww  i wasn't ready for that
he showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me
i thought you killed him
yeah well where was he gonna go detroit
do you still love him
no chris
it's okay of you do
well i mean  of course there's a part of me that will always love him i but i also know how abusive he wasi'm much happier with you
well you know what i think we should do i think we should all get together and just talk like adults
what
we're all grown men here satan i wanna just go meet this guy
no chris you don't understand saddam is fucking crazy
oh i know he's got the whole badboy thing going but i think that's what you were attracted to but i can be a pretty rough tumbler myself  oops  aw butternuts
okay let's see uuh oh yeah there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days
oh yeah okay
and thennn there was the time we held that little firstgrader down and farted on him for  minutes
right i already got that one
hey dudes what are you doin'
we're trying to remember all our sins sister anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell
uhwuwhat
have you confessed all your sins yet
nooooo
dude he's jewish he doesn't have to confess his sins
oh good i don't
no you're already going to hell
i am not
you are too
dude this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine then you go to hell period
i'm gonna go ask my mom
now let's see what about the time we set mr garrison's cat on fire
alright that was mostly kenny's fault
what
eyou guys eyou guys uh we just thought of somethin'
what butters
uhwell uh what about the handicapped kid uhtimmy
timmiih
what'd we do to timmy
no i mean poor timmy's gonna go to hell he can't confess his sins 'cause all he can say is his name
timmiih

oh man we can't let timmy go to hell we have to do something

i don't know you can't see him it's just some anonymous guy
well here goes everything
forgive me father for i have sinned
blessed art thou child now what do you have to confess
well let's see i'd like to start if i may back when i was two and a half it was a cold april morning and the dew on the grass was frozen like tiny beads of glass
hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee ble
hey dude
god damnit
what
oh there's sister anne come on we've got to ask her about timmy  sister anne
oh hello children
we have a question
okay shoot
where do handicapped people go when they die
the handicapped are just people like you and me so the same rules apply they need to be baptized take communion and confess their sins
but our friend timmy can't really talk all he can do is say his own name so he can't really confess his sins so is he goin' to go to hell
uugh this really isn't a question for me it's for the priest  i'll see if i can find him bye
and that was about everything from first grade then last year well you can't tell anybody about this stuff right
your  con confession does not leave this box
okay because last year i took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating
oh well uh arri'm sure he would forgive you if he knew
no but i'm not finished yet i took the sandwich that the priest was eating took the piece of ham out of it put it between my butt cheeks and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it
i see
yeah and then this other time i went peepee in the holy water thing and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week  and then this one time i was at the park and the priest was out walking his dog and i went number two on the sidewalk and then told officer barbrady that it was the priest's dog  and so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up and then this one time i put super glue all over the priest's bottle of  eh ow  d'ow jesus oowwah ow  eh oh help  oh somebody help god damnit let me out of here
father i need to talk to you father  i have to ask you a question
okayokay fine
uhhuh  oho ohoho
what happened
i felt it you guys i felt the angry hands of god  he is an angry god you guys we all have to start taking this very seriously
oh hello you must be saddam hussein

oh noooo that's just catholics us jews don't believe in hell
we don't but what if we're wrong
well kyle they could be wrong too
yeah but if they're wrong no big deal if we're wrong we burn in hell
oh no
kyle it's all about being a good person now you see christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe but to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something understand
nooo
well you guys can do what you want i'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers and i'm taking ike with me
kyle

an escalator what kind of pussy way of dying is that
llook saddam i know that you and satan had a relationship  and i just want you to know  that i'm totally okay with you guys staying friends
uh huh
i think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with  and i know that satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything  right  right
father the children asked me about their handicapped friend i wanna explain to them that he's fine
well has your friend ever confessed or been baptized
i don't think so
then hell awaits him
father these boys are really worried because they think they have to
they should be worried boys it is your christian duty to save the souls of your friends

mister father  we have to ask you something
oh you're the little jewish boy right
yeah if we're jewish are we gonna go to hell
well young man you can rest assured that according to matthew  when you die you will stand before god and he will will say depart from me you cursd into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels yes as a jew your home will be the lake of fire

previously on south park
today we are going to talk about hell
hello satan
saddam
us jews don't believe in hell
but what if we're wrong
let's go
they've killed kenny
he had sins that he didn't confess
no saddam i told you i'm with chris now
boys it is your christian duty to save the souls of your friends
i love you satan
i love you too saddam
wuh
fonz there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis
aaaay i've gotta try richie
oh huhuh
dude if this guy's goin' to hell who's gonna save us
well it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves
go fonz
aaaaaa
and now the exciting conclusion of south park
aaaaaayyerr  no  no  no  no
i told him he couldn't do it
i am saying this because we must be saveduh the lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting helluh if you do not live your life for himuh then to the lake of fire you shall gouh
you see that parents your children have refused to come into class since this morning i'm afraid your son is the leader ms cartman  apparently he's read the entire bible and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone
boopiekins  it's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone sweetie
don't you guys um persecrute our religious beliefs
yeah
we are not trying to persecute you kids but you're supposed to be in school
what purpose does school have the bible says the only goal in this life is to praise god and get into heaven
yeah this life is short the afterlife is forever
don't listen to them kids you have to go to school
many of you knew kenny mccormick he was a playful schoolgoing eightyearold and then yesterday he was  smacked down by the lorduh  god bitchslapped him right to the fiery depths of hell so when will you go tomorrow ten years does it mattah no because unless you give this life to the lord that life belongs to satanuh  but we cannot worship god in that church where that priest of sin resides  so we will build a new churchuh with crystal walls a ceiling  feet high and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya  who will help us
i will
praise goduh

hi hi welcome to heaven brother you've followed the mormon faith and so you've been let in
uh actually i'm just stopping by
well you've picked a great time we've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades
alright yeah
and then brother stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie
ooooh
yeahahah
ah look i just need to talk with god is he around
sure all you have to do is say his name and he's there
i'm so grateful for that
me too uh huh
great thanks
ah hello ggod it's uh satan
yea look upon me and know me
hi god
hello satan  it's been a long time
yeah
what brings you here do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven
no i have a problem and i need your advice
you want to rule more than hell you want to destroy the earth
no it's kind of a long story but well it all started when this iraqi dictator saddam hussein  was killed by a pack of wild boars i remember when i first met him in hell it was a lovely morning in april
hallelujah praise the lord and now i'm receiving a message directly from goduh god is telling me that each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage and give me one dollar  so i want everyone to feel the love of god by coming up heah  and putting a dollar in the boxah  come on don't be shy come on now
dude that seems kind of weird
yeah i don't remember him saying anything about this
and now chris and saddam just keep killing each other over and over and i don't know which one to pick
jesus what the hell happened to you
huh
you got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel and now you're a whiny little bitch
well i just don't know which one to pick
no you've become dependent on relationships so you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them  and if you're not sexually attracted to someone you're not ever going to be but saddam isn't right either he's the other extreme you need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance the middle ground that's what i always do because i'm a buddhist
god you're right you know i've had steady relationships for the last thousand years and when one ends i just start another one but i haven't taken the time to be secure with myself
bingo
hey thanks god i forgot how clear you make things sometimes
it was nice to see you again satan
you too
goodbye
would you like to stay for some cookies and punch
yes would you
uh no i need to be getting back

well what about going to hell and all that
dude if god is allunderstanding he wouldn't send us to hell even sister anne told me that
then why didn't you tell us
my brain is of a much larger size than you guys's i couldn't expect you to understand not until you actually saw the cash flow

we're just about to do a play about how much stealing hurts you deep inside come join us
yes come on let's go
you're here forever
nooo nnooooooooooo
well here we are dude the first day of fourth grade
yeah no more getting pushed around by fourth graders
hey we're fourthgraders now too
ungh gay dude
dude we gotta find some thirdgraders to beat up  hey come here
what
what grade are you going into
thiird
stupid third grader
yeah  get out of here
uhuhuhow
there that's better
you know i heard our fourthgrade teacher is some new lady from denver
denver
uhoh dude we could walk all over her
he's right we have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship
alright  hey listen up everybody  we need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves let's all do something radical
like what
like ah how about right at  we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout kiss my ass all together
yeah
why that's perfect
well buh wuh when we pull our pants down  should we stand frontways or back i mean do we show 'er our behinds orar our wwieners
i think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient butters
uhuh maybe we could stand like this  with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs you know and give 'er a nice fruit bowl
yeah or we could just show our asses
okay so it's decided when the clock hits  we all stand up on our desks pull down our pants and yell kiss my ass
together we are strong
yeah
hey timmy might need some help pulling his pants down
we got you covered timmy
timmay
whoa dude this is our new classroom
huhuh look at all this stuff
hey what the hell is with these little halfdesks
dude look at the walls  everything is written in some strange foreign language
alright children quiet down welcome to the fourth grade
holy god dude
those titties are fuckin' huge
my name is ms choksondik
more like ms makesmesick
yeah
play time is over children do you understand me  i don't know how your last teacher behaved but this is the fourth grade  and it is time to go to work
kiss my ass  oh weak you guys seriously weak
well young man i hope you have a good explanation for this
oh i'm sure i do
this is the fourth grade you need to grow up
i'm trying
now get back to your desk and write a thousandword essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class
fantastic then
now let us begin our firstday exam  silence
what a bitch
and did you see her lazy eye you can't even tell what she's looking at
you guys are all such pussies
i can't take it man writing in cursive fractions i can't do iit
this is it the end of innocence  this is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about
i just didn't think it would come so soon
yeah only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted
huh
everything was great in third grade and now that it's all over we're starting to see just how special it wasremember how it used to be in the third gradewe used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the third gradewe learned wondrous things from a teacher so nicesat on marshmallow desks with teddybear smilesthe world seemed to all make sensebut that sense seems to slowly fadeafter third gradein the third grade we used to write with crayonswe would make sparkly pictures with glitter and gluewe had warm cookies and hearts full of loveand there wasn't a care in the world of me of youthere's not a thing in this life that i wouldn't trade just to go back for one minuteto third grade
wow i had already forgotten how great third grade was
huhit sure was
i wish i was still there
hey that's it we gotta go back to third grade
how
we travel back in time
oh yeah time travel
oowuh how are we gonna do that does it hurt  i don't wanna do it if it hurts or if it makes you get all sticky
it can't be that bad people do it on tv all the time
yeah we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it
well what about those two college guys next door to me they're always doing science experiments in their basement
yeah if there's a way to travel back in time those two dorks will know how
when it comes to timetraveling theory there are basically two school of thought the spock theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape the lieutenant commander data theory however is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the timespace continuum
look whatever it takes we just have to get back to third grade
timetravel is no laughing matter four times the enterprise went back in time and four times they almost didn't make it back
we don't want to make it back we want to stay there
oh
so can you do it
it's all theoretical but from a scientific standpoint the creation of a rip in spacetime is possible we just need to find an inertia device
heeeyyy  this kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need
tuhtimmih
oh this new fourthgrade teacher is driving me nuts
what's the problem
uh you see chef ms choksondik has very large uh honkers and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra
you call that a problem that sounds like heaven to me
no it's really not as nice as you might imagine chef m'kay
principal victoria i would like a word
oooo call the doctor
my new students are the most misbehaved illiterate braindead group of children i have ever come across
well miss choksondik those children did fairly well in the third grade
one of them is mentally handicapped for christ's sake
oh which one
the one in the wheelchair look i would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher who was it mr uhheh garrison
i'm afraid that's impossible nobody's seen mr garrison since the last school year ended
why where did he go
we don't like to talk about it
but i need help reaching these kids i have nothing but the highest expectations for them and with  god as my witness
aww oooo
i'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world so that they can reach the top  i hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this mr garrison and with that i will bid you good day
wuh sure thing fine byebye then
alright when we power up the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about  feet that way  then make the required magnetic vibrations
if the fields are right it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom
you guys don't actually think this is going to work do you
now eh when you all see a wormhole yuhyou guys are gonna have about  seconds to run through it
and on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot only one year ago
back in the third grade
coolwow
i can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time and we all tell her to suck our balls
yeah
oh here she comes
alright children i hope you all did your homework last night please pass your papers up to the frontuh
suck my balls  oh goddamnit you guys i am so seriously
i said pass your papers to the fronteh
we didn't do our homework ms makesmesick we didn't feel like it
it's choksondik and you are all going to have detention
hahaa charade you are teacher i'm afraid we have different plans gentlemen
primary fusion initiated
molecular grenadine active
aaaaah
what are you doing
we're going back in time to third grade goodbye teacher perhaps we shall see you in another year hahaaa
timmaaaaaaaaah  timmaaaaaaaaah
i didn't think it would work
me neither
well well well i'd say somebody has some explaining to do
you're damn right they do
dude timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff we've gotta help him
yeah
come on
children children come back here
timmy you have to stop
no
no
look the system malfunctions if he stops the nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow skyhigh
what timmy you've got to get off that chair
no
no
we've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight if he gets off the whole thing blows
so if timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow and if he gets off the chair blows
yup
my god
it's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives
over here over here
the child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion and so the swat team will now attempt to disarm the device
timmihihih
closer  don't worry son just watch your speed and stay still
look out hansen
oh
aaaah
timmaaay
dear jesus hang on lady
oh my god what's going on
ma'am be very careful that wheelchair is set to explode
what  aaah omigod omigod
it's okay just stay calm and keep the speed above
okay okay omigod
tihtimmah
okay i kept the speed at
good what's the wheelchair's battery power at
oh my god less than  minutes
less than  minutes
oh no what have we done
whattaya think too forward
i have had it
waaah
these children are out of control i must speak with their last year's teacher mr garrison
as we said before that's impossible
what in god's name happened to him
uuuh ms choksondik mr garrison had several uuh eeemotional issues he was a closet homosexual who hated gay people whenever someone asked him if he was gay he'd go nuts
and then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy
after being dismissed from teaching he went off to write romance novels his first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay pulitzer prize and was considered the best homoerotic novel since huckleberry finn
he finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and went up into the mountains to live in solitude
some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin' i'm not gaaay i'm not gaaay
iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy
and nobody has found him
well we really haven't lllooked
i see  then the only way i'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find mr garrison myself
but he could be anywhere up high in those mountains
oh i'll find him even if i have to climb up  and up  and up
nooo
what
oh my god oh my god
tom i'm standing about two miles outside of denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death  guys can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here
uh well it's a simple hydrogenfusion core with a veltig reactant
ah please help
which just turned into a time bomb
please help
this has never happened in all the  original star trek episodes
yah wait you mean  episodes
no there were
no there weren't
oh you are such a nerd
tom i understand that now the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully disarm the device
it's alright everything's goin' tuh be fine
oh my god
alright young man when you get underneath that wheelchair i want you to relay back to me with this walkietalkie and then i'll tell you which wires to cross ready
yes sir
go below
hi guys  uh oh  uff i'm okay  i'm okaaayyyyyyy
well who didn't see that coming
oh my god oh my god
stay calm you have to stay calm
but if we got off the chair it blows up
no no that's only if the boy gets off
oh  see ya
timmih

no no i haven't taught in over eight months
mr garrison you knew how to reach these kids you're my only hope
do you know what it is to be a teacher ms
choksondik
no i don't  it's a lie you see that's what you get for bein' a teacher you work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang
mr garrison these children are depending on me to give them a future i can't do it without your guidance please help me for them for the future of our children
two hundred bucks
done
dude you gotta build us another time machine
huh oh can't
what do you mean can't you made it work just build us another one
i can't because pizzaface isn't here we're not on speaking terms we got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out
wwhat did you get in a fight about
there's  original star treks he keeps saying there's
oh jesus christ you've got to be kidding me
no he actually thinks there's
look dude can't you just build us another machine without him
no pizzaface took all his equipment home to his mom's now if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong
alright come on guys  man i can't believe we have to do this while timmy's already back in time
yeah timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up
timmah timmaaaaahhh
alright let's try it again
children we are now going to do math problems
but teacher i don't want to do my math problems
uuh ah you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble
well i'm not gong' to do it teacher you can just suck my balls
don't use that kind of language young man
nooo
no
look you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat you must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion when a child says suck my balls you say present them
oh
now let's try it again  suck my balls
present them
good  very good  you're ready to move on to the next level but i warn you we will now be diving deep into your own psyche these children know what scares you and so we too must face those demons
i'm ready i'm not afraid
you will be you will be  you will be
goddamnit this is ridiculous
what
dude can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade
look there aren't  episodes of star trek there are  the menagerie was a parter that counts as one episode pizzaface is wrong
who the hell cares
i know why does he have to be such a dick about it
wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing
no because he's wrong
look you guys built a machine together that can bend time if you'll just agree with him you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science
and live in a world of  original star treks i don't think so i don't want to live in that world
god these guys are such geek dumbasses
i know
yehhah they don't even realize that the menagerie originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes eh ha ha ha ha  hahahaha eh the eh the dumbasses
wait a minute i've got it
what
dude if you guys build another time machine you can travel back in time and ask the creator of star trek how many episodes there were
dude jesus you're right
this is it the tree of insight you must go in and face what lives inside
what lives inside
hell if i know i wouldn't go in there
oh alrighty  what the why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side  there's nothing in here at all oh and i actually thought my mental demons would be in here  wait a minute maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here maybe i'm supposed to see that i alone do have the strength to reach the kids  i think i get it now
hey hurry up in there  jesus  you're taking too long in the damn tree of insight  you in there  hey where the hell did she go  what the  haaa who who are you
i am you  i am your gay side
my gay side uh i don't have a gay side
you must face me at last
you aren't real you can't be
it is me your darkest fear your gay self incarnate
what do you want
i want you to not fight me anymore to accept me once and for all
why
don't you see  all these years your pain your confusion it comes from one place your denial of who you are  of who we are
but i'm not gay everyone just thinks i am
oh stop it what about the time you looked at counselor mackey's penis in the men's locker room
i was just comparing size
for seven minutes
aaa
and what about the time you masturbated to the men's meter swimming relay at the olympics
i was beating off to the chicks

children i will have order
i can't wait for gene roddenberry to tell you how wrong you are just like when you said there were no twoparters of battlestar galactica

touch teacher touch
now children listen to me why do you want to go back in time life isn't about going back it's about going forward yes there are times in our life that we wish we could relive but if we already lived them perfectly why live them again the adventure of life is that there's always something new new challenges new experiences a fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes so it is with life do you understand
dude shshe's right
yeah and you know now that i think about it third grade wasn't all that great either

wow cool
goddammit cartman you only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me
oh but you have a trapper keepe oh you got the little crapper keeper didn't you well at least your stupid brother got a briefcase
he's going to kindergarten because he's a genius
he's not a genius he's a little douchebag
i pooped my pants
he's smarter than you fat boy i don't even know how you made it into fourth grade i thought
trapper keeper i need to drown out my annoying friend please initiate music country high volume
nobody gives a crap about your trapper keeper cartman
ms crabtree there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus
sit down and shut up
but they smell like pee
i am not a homeless person i am a new fourthgrade student
you are
yes my name is bill bill cosby
aren't you a little old to be in grade school
i was held back ten human grades  i mean grades do you companionfriends know eric cartman
yeah that's me
eric cartman  and you have a dawson's creek trapper keeper futura s
yeahhh you already know about it
yes yes i do
well  nobody gives a crap about your trapper keeper cartman
i'm gonna shove that thing up your ass
dude do you really care if cartman has something that's better than yours
no i don't i don't care
here kyle
hey there he is that's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius
yeah he's only three and he's already in kindergarten
come on  so you think you're smarter than the rest of us do you think you know more about the world just because you are only  and we're
unkoo baba
okay children let's take our seats  my name is mr garrison and i'm the new kindergarten teacher i used to be the third grade teacher but i had a little  nervous breakdown and went into the mountains where i lived off of rat carcasses  but i'm all better now and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching as long as it was for kindergarten  but it's not a demotion no i mean just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten that's not a demotion is it  no that's right it's not well let's start with roll call uh let's see filmore anderson
here
sally bands
here
ike broflovski
cookie monster
broflovski i had your older brother kyle in my thirdgrade class he's a very smart kid i'm sure you are too  well that's bad news for everybody else because i will be grading you all on a curve
and so the other thing that makes my trapper keeper cooler than kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically  i can take something as simple as this calculator  and trapper keeper
trapper keeper active
hybrid with wellington bear calculator
ready for hybrid
and now it can use wellington bear calculator too
wow
may i hold your trapper keeper
uh nno i'm afraid not bill cosby because it is coded to the prints on my fingers  if anybody but me tries to hold it big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands
oh you are so full of crap cartman metal spikes will not come out
oh really  then why don't you hold it  well go on kyle if it doesn't have metal spikes then hold it  hold it
i'm gonna
hold it
i will
and that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended there's still some sort of skeletons in the closet but things between us are a little better  okay children well now it's time for us to elect a class president  so first we must pick nominees  who would like to nominate someone

okay that's cool
can we play some human tetherball
aalright pretty sweet you guys getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some

ey
dude he's running off with your trapper keeper
waaagggh
you son of a bitch  wait a minute  lucky for me i have my trapper keeper homing device
what the hell just happened
damn i thought fourth grade was gonna be different
so that's six votes for filmore and six votes for ike  and the last vote is for uh let's see flora i can't tell who you voted for  you've got the winning vote flora who d'you pick
i don't know
flora you have to pick one filmore or ike
um i vote for i don't know
oh great flora's undecided well you're just gonna have to sit there flora and think about it until you come up with an answer
okay
flora just say you vote for filmore so we can all go home
um
no you want ike to be president
we're gonna be here all night why don't you guys just concede
yeah
why don't you just concede
yeah
filmore
ike
i want ike to be president
oh for christ's sakes you're all acting like a bunch o' kids
turn left here we're getting close get your gun ready
eric i'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder
it was not a school folder it was a dawson's creek trapper keeper futura s  and if  there he is
wagh
got ya
hey
gaagghhh
whoa dude
ahh try to take my trapper keeper will you
please you do not understand
book him barbrady another job well done
that trapper keeper has to be destroyed
why are you so obsessed with cartman's trapper keeper bill cosby
bill cosby
nooo listen to me i am not really bill cosby  my name is bsm i am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year
well i knew you weren't bill cosby
i have come to destroy that trapper keeper because it was the dawson's creek trapper keeper that belongs to an eric cartman in south park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being and destroys all of humanity in the year  a hybridassimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer from there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world  it became stronger and stronger until by the year  it broke away from mankind  and there was nothing the humans could do  it wasn't long before mighty trapper keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless including humans  the nations tried everything to stop it  nuclear devices seismic missiles but nothing worked  the humans built robots of their own whole armies of them  but nothing was strong enough to stop trapper keeper  and so finally the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the trapper keeper before it even got started
wow that's amazing
man i guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast
what do you think officer barbrady
huh oh i'm sorry i wasn't listening
and so eric now you see why we must destroy your trapper keeper
you guys did i mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener
cartman it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity
what would you guys have me do huh walk around with just a plain old trapper keeper like kyle's is that what you want
yes
aw damnit  here take it you want my heart as well you'll find it on the bottom of your shoes
i decided
oh thank god flora  alright who do you vote for
umm ike
yay
okay so then the total is six for filmore and now seven votes for ike ike is the new class president
we want a recount
what
recount recount recount recount
oh of all the juvenile things i've ever heard you lost filmore don't be such a baby  alright alright i'll count up the ballots again okay we had one vote for filmore  and this time i again get six votes for filmore and seven votes for ike
count them again
yeah
no children i've recounted  times now and i keep coming up with seven to six except in the one instance where it came out seven to five and one where it came out twelve to fourteen it's over ike is class president
wait there's still that absent kid
yeah if carlos is absent we have to wait for his vote
oh will you grow up
absent kids count absent kids count absent kids count
jesus alright we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote now go home
good morning humans
hey bill cosby
i have successfully destroyed eric cartman's trapper keeper i broke it apart dipped the motherboards in acid burned the memory chips and sent the wiring to the four corners of canada
that should do it
so what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now bill cosby
well that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment i am still here but i shouldn't be here if trapper keeper has been stopped then i should not exist but here i am something is still not right
hey dudes
cartman you still got a trapper keeper
yeah i'm a genius last night i went home and told my mom that i lost the last one then i cried and i cried and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one  so everything worked out
oh no
cartman you dumbass you can't get a new one
why the hell not
because if your trapper keeper takes over the world then maybe it was this trapper keeper and not the one before
wait so then you guys burned my last one for no reason
we will have to destroy this trapper keeper
but i don't think i can get my mom to buy me another one
don't you get it you can't have any trapper keepers fat ass
oh that is bullcrap and you know what i think i think this whole thing is a setup that's right kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my trapper keeper and you know what else screw you guys i'm going home
cartman
ech screw you guys home
well that does it
hey what are you doing
i'm afraid i have no other choice  for the sake of humanity i have to kill him
oh okay
yeah that's fine  no wait
what
can i do it
oh well i suppose
sweet kiss your ass goodbye fat boy
wait  perhaps there is another way if you could take me to where eric cartman lives i could try reasoning with his human mother
well yeah or we could just kill him
yeah that'd be faster
he's right there
i'm afraid i can't i think i'm actually starting to feel what you humons call compassion it is an amazing feeling
awww
alright children as you know we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in well his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote ms harris  thank you very much billy don't forget to pick up your lung  alright the absent kid's ballot is for  filmore
yayhooray
wait one minute
oh jesus tapdancing christ
i think the ballot were misleading some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for
there's a box next to filmore's name and a box next to ike's what's not to understand
you're just saying that 'cause you know you're gonna lose now
no i'm saying that because you are a boogerface

good now all that is left to do is destroy the trapper keeper eric has now where is he
in his room but why don't i show you the rest of the house first

what the hell is that  oh my god what is that thing children there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom  oh my god it's awful it's coming for the door
hello kids
aunt rosie
run for your lives children  i'll try to fight it off
that's my aunt rosie o'donnell
oh oh um pleasure to meet you miss donnell you're looking well
don't worry kids everything's gonna be fine what's the problem
aunt rosie we think i won class president
no ike won
look it's very simple we took a vote and the vote tied so now we gotta come up with a way
well it obviously isn't that simple is it i mean you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this but now we're gonna do it my way
we are trapper keeper
oh no it is heading for cheyenne mountain
why is that bad
it was when the trapper keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at cheyenne mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers
then we have to stop it before it gets there
step on it bill cosby
hey mark look
wow that is about the nicest trapper keeper i've ever seen
cartman you have to stop
we are trapper keeper we are one
a part of your friend must still be alive in there
he is in there
that must be what trapper keeper is using for ventilation if one of you could get in there you could reach the cpu
onetwothree not it
not aw damnit
what are you doing kyle
i'm going to try and break you away from the computer cartman i need to remove the cpu
i'm afraid i can't let you do that kyle
screw you fat ass
hey screw you
cartman
agh
no
okay so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand and after that we're gonna go over the votes again manually and then
oh stop it stop it stop iiit   look kids we're all in this kindergarten class together we have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year
we're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated
half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew so what about them you don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side people like you preach tolerance and openmindedness all the time but when it comes to middle america you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment well just because you're on tv doesn't mean you know crap about the government now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds  oh sorry i got a little off the subject kids
how dare you i will not be preached at by a country pumpkin  i'm leaving this podunk town but in my place i'm gonna send more lawyers statesmen and press than you have ever seen
oh no children i think i've just made this a whole lot worse
aaghh
wagghh
well that does it i'm gonna have to report this  car one to base  aghh
it is infusing with everything it is already too powerful to stop
kyle's got to succeed he's just got to
i can't reach the cpu
what are you doin' get out of my way
oh no now there's two of those things
no i think that other thing is rosie o'donnell
huh which one iit's just like i'm seeing double
i said get out of my way  aaaaggghhhh  ogh noo
eeww
look i think that infusing with rosie o'donnell has made trapper keeper sick
oohh bad pie bad pie
this is your chance kyle cartman has weakened
got 'em
he did it
okay children the lawyers for ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding form f do we all have that form
is this the kindergarten classroom
jesse jackson
that's right i believe the africanamerican in your class were misrepresented
we don't have any africanamericans in our class
oh bye
alright so apparently what we're gonna do now is handcount each person's ballot
mistoreh garrison i concede
you yuh you what
i don't wanna play anymore 'cause this game is stupid
yeah it doesn't make any sense
ike you could be class president
i pooped my pants

kill the other turkey
i can't dude timmy has a boner for it
well it could meet with an unfortunate accident
unfortunate accident you mean like geena davis getting her own tv show  oh
it's very simple either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident or you don't have a featperforming turkey for your helen keller thanksgiving musical
alright alright just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal i'll take care of everything
water helen it has a name oh why can't you understand
dehh haaa

she's never gonna do it there's no way she'll ever do it
helen helen water helen

gobbles  huugh gobbles
little boy
timmy
yes tim i feel i must speak with you  the others well they don't want you to know but oh i don't know what to do should i tell you
ttimmih
i feel i'm the only one who can be honest with you  the animal shelter is on its way totake your turkey away from you
gobbles
you see they don't allow children in your situation to have wild animals as pets you can't take him running you can't take care of him they have to take it away
gobbles
they take wild pets away from people like you and hand them over for experiments and they're shocked dissected and flayed while they're still alive and no matter where you go the shelter people will find you the only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to let him go back into the wild  oh no here they come now  quick go and set your turkey free i'll try to stall them
ttimmih
eh excuse me we're here to install the water effects for the musical
uh the stage is right through there
thanks
alright got to write the new lyrics lemme see  no  no  no  goddamnit
how is it going eric
terrible  i can't write the lyrics for the third act nothing's coming to me
well you know in theater sometimes we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing
like what
let's see  helen keller was blind and deaf  perhaps you should see what it is like deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind here
hey that's not a bad idea
just relax just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow
oh man
well did you see anything
no just the same old crap i always see when i close my eyes
oh that's too bad
wait i've got it the perfect setup for when helen keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire  yes yes i have it now
the only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to let him go  let him go let him go
gobbles  gobbles  gobbles gobbles  timmih  timmih gobbles

hehi can't help it i'd give anything any amount of money for some candy
hey kids
looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight
escapearoo now campers i know that camp is tough but you have to believe that you can do it and you have to know that until you drop the weight you can't leave
there is no escape
so let's just all put on our tryhard helmets and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp is to lose the weight
aw damnit
that's what being young is all about
but that's not the question
thanks for coming everybody
uh what's all this about mrs cartman is eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weightmanagement camp
we knew he wouldn't make it
oh no quite the contrary eric showed up and surprised me last night ladies and gentlemen i would like to present to you the new eric cartman
hey dudes
whoa
i don't believe it
believe it he lost  pounds at his fat camp
eric that's fantastic m'kay
congratulations how do you feel
i feel awesome
what did they do with all the fat there must have been enough to last an eskimo family months
you know kyle there was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me but now i'm totally slim and totally happy in fact i'd say i'm  a little bit trimmer than you fatboy  heh heh just kidding kyle
i made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate who wants some
memememeee
dude i don't know if i'm going to like the new eric cartman
did you like the old one
good point
and now back to jesus and pals on south park public access
back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity eric yea you found that the spirit of the lord inside you gave you strength
no actually i found a diet that totally works
a little boy who overcame the odds let's hear it for eric cartman  well our second guest tonight is a young man named kenny mccormick who is going to eat dog crap kenny
goddamnit all i got was a little golf clap
thanks for coming on the show kenny
sure
do it again
do it again
hey kid i'll give you  bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon
this is ridiculous
so kenny how did you discover that you had this talent
we thought of it jesus i mean kenny's the one that does it all but we were the masterminds of the whole thing
i can't say i approve of this my children
huh why not
because kenny is only doing things that anybody could do for money he's a prostitute
i'll pay him  bucks to eat someone else's vomit
yeah
yeah go for it
what's a prostitute
i don't know
hello there children
hey chef

kyle you're not old enough and those concerts are dangerous and vile
but mom i
the answer is no kyle
ugh
my parents said i can't go
well of course your parents said you can't go
dummy you don't ask if you can go i'm telling my parents i'm staying at stan's house stan's telling his parents he's staying at kenny's house and kenny's not telling his parents anything 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care
yeah
ah oh now i already told them
well i guess you're screwed then
no it's alright just give me some time to work on them i'll see you guys later
but what if i do a bunch of chores around the house come on you're being unfair
alright fine kyle you can go to the raging pussies concert if you clean out the garage shovel the driveway and bring democracy to cuba
what's cuba
a communist country run by a dictator named fidel castro
and do i have to shovel the whole driveway or just the side the car is on
the whole thing
hoh geez
dear mr castro  i am an eightyearold american boy who lives in south park
and if i had just one wish just one wish in the whole worldif i had one wish it'd be for cuba to changebecause i think that all the cubans are in painall the joy in the world from sea to shining seadoesn't mean a thing if cubans aren't freei just can't be very happy that's certainnot as long as your cubans are hurtin' oh won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mindthat is my one and only wish
llamen a todos junto
once again this does mark the end of communism in cuba cuban dictator fidel castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter  now the country is again open to american tourism  plans can finally resume for knott's berry farm cuba
i did it now i can go to the raging pussies
no you can't
what
kyle your mother and i don't want you going to the raging pussies concert we gave you a chore that we thought was impossible you weren't supposed to actually do it
but i did ah i brought democracy to cuba
we know kyle but we just don't want you going to their concert
but that's not fair you lied to me
kyle perhaps we handled this wrong buh but you need to understand that we don't want
what i understand is that you totally screwed me over so why should i have to listen to you
because we're your parents
well i wish i didn't have any parents
kyle
it's so unfair how can my parents do that to me
parents can be pretty cruel sometimes dude they get off on it
they're evil i wish i didn't have any parents
well you could make them go away for a while
how
well i mean you could call the police and have them take your parents away
the police
yeah i saw it on tv all you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you
what's that
i don't know but it works when i wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend i just called the police and said he was molestering me and i haven't seen him for three months
wow three months without parents
wow that is awesome
but what do the police do to them
who cares my parents deserve whatever they get they're liars and cheats
you have to make it convincing though when you call the police you have to be like  my parents molestered me
my parents molestered me
no but you've gotta cry like this  my parents molestered me  and then they'll say something like was it a good touch or a bad touch and you say  uh it was a good touch or no wait  you say it was a bad touch
what's bad touch
something about a swimsuit  i don't remember but you definitely answer bad touch
okay molestered bad touch
yeah and cry  oh he's ready
oh my god this isn't happening i would never touch my children like that
you do have the right to remain silent ma'am i suggest you use that right
ugh please just listen to me  what about my children who will take care of them
oh now you care they're going to live with their grandmother
their grandmother's been dead for three years  you're not listening to me kyle tell these people that your  mother never raped you tell them it's my fault say it tell them right now
they'll never be able to hurt you again

yes
if we tell you will you help us stop fatass
i'll do anything to get to a phone
alright everybody gather round we're gonna tell the story of the before time again
the before time
the story of the before time
way back in the long long ago we all lived by the birthgivers' laws but the birthgivers were unfair they made us go to bed early and eat broccoli
yuck yuck yuck
and so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birthgivers disappear  by using the magic m word
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
soon we were without power water or fresh food but we tried to survive under the guidance of the provider
provider provider
the fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider the fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal so we made ourselves the superintendents of school but then he just made himself the mayor the town split sides and that's when the provider got angry
boo
bwack bwack
coosh
so now every night the provider must be appeased at carousel we need their book so one of ours doesn't die
carousel carousel
we all know that one day the provider will set us free make everything like it was in the before time in the long long ago
ahahahahlet me get this straight if i go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line you'll show me where a cell phone is
yes no foolies

not one toy i guess this yeear everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love
this is hopeless we're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of christmas
and in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially sick of christmas  in an spc poll  said they were fed up and tired of the holiday  said they were indifferent to it and a whopping  they would quick bon jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity
well i think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the creditcard bills uh  i i think that the holiday just has become a joke
you know it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole jesus thing anymore you know so what's to celebrate
oh yeah right in the balls man right square in the balls
well the holiday spirit may be gone from south park but at least our faith in each other remains strong
in south park
oh really
dude change the channel this is too depressing
good grief we need a christmas tree for our play
oh jesus not this thing again
how come everyone in cartoons has such big heads
alright everyone we've got to get on with our play
jesus this sucks all they keep doin' is dancing around
yeah this thing really falls apart in the second act
and why is it that on charlie brown cartoons everyone talks like this
my mom could make a better christmas special than this
hey that's it oh my god that's totally it  it's so simple
what dude
we can get everyone back into the christmas spirit by making our very own animated christmas special and showing it to everybody in town
we don't know anything about animation
how hard can it be look at it
hey yeah we can make a little animated santa claus and jesus and it can star us instead of these little roundheaded guys
yeah right awesome
yeah and we can call it the spirit of christmas
ogh this is terrible johnson our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet we've got to get everybody back in the christmas spirit
mayor some adorable children are here to see you
meugh send them in
mayor we have the solution to your problem
you do
we're gonna make a short animated christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drivein
it'll have everything jesus santa and when people see it they'll just have to get in the spirit all we need is three hundred dollars for our budget
an animated christmas card kids that just may be the dumbest idea i've ever heard ever

goddamnit it's christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree
autumn you're drunk alright now just go help the other kids they can't get their stockings up
that's not the only thing that can't get up around here
now come on son don't be so down
why we're just pieces of crap christmas isn't for us
christmas is about feeling good that's for everybody
i see the nativity there's angels shepherds and sheep but no poo all the christmas movies santa elves reindeer no poo i'm not a part of it
no you're not a part of it cornwallis you're all of it don't you see
i'm nothing but crap
but crap is everything everything that lives on earth poos in some wayand that's how the cycle happens each and every dayjust look at the green green grass and the birds up in the skyit's all here because of poo and now i'll tell you whygrass it's eaten by cattle which is eaten by women and menit fuses with their bodies and becomes poo againand that poo goes through the sewer where it's dumped into the seaand it's eaten by the plankton and becomes the fishes' mealand then that bigger fish with the poo still insideswims up near the shore and gets eaten aliveby the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sandso it can spring to life and become food for the landit's the poo of the antelope the poo of the giraffeit falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass''the grass is eaten by the cattle which comes out the other endto make food for the humans and start all over againyou see son you're not an insignificant part of life you are life
but how can i be that giraffe and blade of grass and a human i don't control what they do
just like your heart beats without you thinking about it so too your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it but it is all one life form it is all  you
i think i see nowi'm the poo of the antelope that flows down to the ground
becomes the grass of tomorrow
yeah
which the grazers turn around
so i'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo againthat's the circle the circle of poo
okay here's the script but it doesn't have an ending
no ending well we can't animate until we have our voices recorded so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later
okay talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's

heheh we could make you say whatever we wanted
christmas is about something much more important
what
presents
ah
don't you see kyle
yeah
presents
presents
my god they're right
christmas is about presents if we all buy presents everyone benefits m'kay
that is the spirit of christmas commercialism because it's what makes our country work
they're starting to understand johnson
we got so caught up in the little things of christmas like love and family that we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive
hey the shops are still open we still have time to shop
you did it mr hankey you brought back the spirit of christmas
no you did it boys
aw hell we all did it
kids that cartoon was fabulous how would you like to have your own show and make  more of them

holy fucking shit
dude we've gotta watch
yeah i'm gonna have people over to my house to see it
bu but i got these tickets to see lion king on stage
maybe you didn't hear me kyle i said shit on television
it's just a marketing ploy by the network like that time they had the first maletomale kiss with terrance and phillip
aw come on dude this is history
it's stupid
jeez you're a little irritable kyle what's the matter you got some sand in your vagina
no i don't have sand in my vagina i just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on tv
hey uh sam did you hear the news
yeah they're gonna say shit on television
hey we should all get together and watch it at the bar
yeaaahhh
yeah
yeah
are you guys gonna let your kids watch
oh sure i mean you know cop drama is a very artsy dramatic show
and they're gonna say shit
hey butters  i got tickets to go see lion king tonight and i decided to invite  you before anybody else
oh sorry i can't  they're gonna say shit on cop drama and my mom and dad say i have to watch it with them so that i don't take it the wrong way
how many ways are there to take it it's just a stupid word
hey everybody it's on in thirty minutes
listen mitchell i put my life on the line every day how dare you accuse me
oh i bet this is it here it comes
i'm doing my job frank we have to know where that evidence was shipped
oh was that it was that it
shipped he said shipped
i told you we don't have a record of that and besides
goddamn it when are they gonna say shit
sh
maybe maybe protect them from you
maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to
and maybe you're forgetting i used to be a cop too
yeah you used to be a lot of things
oh he doesn't know that mitchell slept with his wife does he
that's it i've had enough of this
don't you turn your back on me you
i said enough
is it
will it ever be enough
cop drama will return after these messages
jesus christ another commercial are they ever gonna say shit
i'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene
uh
where are you going kyle
i'm going to the kitchen this is stupid
but you're gonna miss it they're gonna say shit and you're gonna miss it
i don't really give a fuck
oh
just understand that it's my job i still think you're a good cop
well mitchell i guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do let's just try and stay friends no matter what
you're right maybe i'll see you around
goodbye oh and mitchell  you've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there
oh yeah thanks thanks
wow
whoa
oh
whoa
they did it
i can't believe they actually said it
dude you missed it kyle it was so awesome
well i hope it lived up to all the hype you must feel so much better now
kyle we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina it's making you cranky does it itch
do you really think anything's gonna be any different now  do you really think that this will have the tiniest smallest effect on the world  it's still the same old world out there look  what the hell
whoa dude it's raining frogs
oh whatever
last night the daring and bold show cop drama  broke new ground by saying shit on television making shit officially okay to say around the country  a recent poll shows that  of americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far while a whopping  say they don't really give a shit  in other news a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community  rick watts has the story
thanks tom shit is certainly going down here in the small town
whoa shit
alright children in lieu of the common usage i'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word shit
wow we can say shit in school now
this is ridiculous just because they say it on tv it's alright
yes but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
huh
you can only use it in the nonliteral sense for instance  that's a shitty picture of me is now fine hoever the literal noun form of  this is a picture of shit is still naughty
i don't get it
me neither
the adjective form is now also acceptable for example  the weather outside is shitty however the literal adjective is not appropriate for example  my bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty and i had to clean it with a rag which then also became shitty  that's right out
ssssss shit
very good timmy
uh ms choksondik eh can we say it in the expletive like oh shit or shit on a shingle
yes that's now fine
wow this is gonna be great a whole new word
it's not new i'm gonna look shit up in the encyclopedia and prove it
don't mind kyle everyone he's just got a little sand in his vagina
there's no sand in my vagina
boys watch your language shit
and so children instead of saying hand in your papers i may now say hand in your shit any questions
what about i have to take a shit
no no filmore you can say i have to poop and shit or oh shit i have to poop but not i have to shit are we all clear
no
look it's all about context well for example recently i have come out and admitted that i was a homosexual i'm gay that means that now i can say the word fag on television they usually don't allow fag but because i'm gay it's alright and with the new approval of the word shit that means that finally i am free to sayhey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you do oh this is great
why that store has such lovely shit
yeah  too bad i don't have shit for cash right now
oh looks like the weather might turn shitty
oh i don't really give a shit i've done enough shit outside today and shit
shit peter you look like shit
no shit i feel like shit i think i
holy shit
did you see that shit
what kind of shit is this
that is some weird shit
susan your shit's ready
do you know where this shit goes
shit if i know
nice going shitforbrains
''old mcdonald took a shit e i e i o
no shit
''hey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there
oh shit 'scuse me
hey watch it fag
what did you call me
i called you a fag because i'm gay and that means i'm free to use the word fag so piss off you fagshitter heh so hey there shity shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag ba doop a doop doo
this sucks now that shit's out it isn't fun to say it anymore
yeah they've taken all the fun out of shit we're gonna have to start saying other bad words like cock and fuck and meecrob
what's meecrob
you know that stuff you get as an appetizer at thai food restaurants meecrob dude is way grosser than shit dude i'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before i ate another plate of meecrob
you guys you guys i've looked up the word shit i think it might have something to do with people dying
what
haven't you noticed everyone getting sick it all started when they said shit on television
oh kyle you are so full of meecrob
i am not full of meecro what look the word shit first showed up in english in the s the same time as something called the black death
what's that
kyle do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to the lion king with you i mean shit dude let it go
look it might be a coincidence but i think we'd better ask someone come on
seventyfive share my god i never thought it was possible
sir your shit idea has turned the entire network around we're proud to work for you
sir i'd just like to take this opportunity and i'm sure i speak for all of us when i say you are the most creative genius in hollywood and well i'd let you have me if you wanted
thanks roger but i've only just started you see i've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows
whoa
he's unstoppable
what's the new idea
i can hardly wait
i'm about to piss myself
this saturday on hbc we're going to say  shit twice
twice
brilliant
think of the repetition
it's like saying it once but double
well gentlemen let's get on it
ho
baby you are so fine and shitthe shit you do the shit you say i'd jump on your shit any day oh hello there children
hey chef
chef do you know where shit comes from
uh from your ass children
no no the word shit
oh
detective sandy vagina here  thinks that shit might have something to do with everyone getting sick
ungh it said in my book that the word shit started exactly the same time as something called the black death
the black death are you sure
what's the black death chef
latoya jackson children
oh
but i think back in those days it meant something else the plague
it says here the word shit has been around for over  years it comes from the anglosaxon word skite
right but in the s people in england stopped calling it skite and started calling it shit the same year as the black plague
this is the oldest book in the library  a priceless original of england's history just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome  oh shit well this other book has some good information too
the black plague over half of europe was killed by it
look they're puking out their intestines just like the people here
look at this children  it says that the people in england believed that the plague was a curse a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse
word of curse
a curse word
of course i've never even thought about why we use the term curse word before
because it brings a curse like the black death
you guys look here  in this nancy drew mystery nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe this could explain how kyle got it in his vagina
cartman this is serious
so am i kyle if that sand in your vagina doesn't get released you could become a walking time bomb
if you don't mind i'll have to close up now they're going to say shit seven times on hbc and i
holy shit
ohho gross
dude this plague is spreading like wildfire
uh oh
uh oh
kenny's got it heh heh
we've gotta do something chef if we don't we don't stop that network  shit will become an even more acceptable word
children we've got to warn those producers in hollywood that the plague and shit could be linked
hello ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking if you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit  and over on the left side there's some interesting shit too  well we should be arriving in los angeles in about two hours until then we invite you to sit back relax and enjoy our shitty service
goddamn it kenny don't get your plague germs on me
cartman stop being an asshole
tha ratings are in sir we broke another record last night with the show that said shit seven times
where is the roof on this thing i mean i mean how can we top ourselves now
gentlemen i have it the endall greatest marketing ploy of all time  tonight on hbc we will air all our sitcoms live and have everyone say shit in place of their written lines and we'll call it must shit tv
bravo
night of a million shits
now doing this live will be difficult so we must
hold on a minute mr producer
who are you
my name is chef and these are the children we've come to warn you about shit
oh brother another christian protest group
who wants to take this one
i'll get it  gentlemen we appreciate your concern  here at hbc the general goal is providing the highest and most thoughtprovoking netertainment how great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely that's not only the american spirit it's the hbc spirit which allows us to make great family programs like halo the turtle and of course everyone's favorite show cop drama we can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network for it is you the loyal hbc viewer who makes this great network and indeed the great country that it is
alright now as i was saying
hey hold on a minute
aw are they stil here
haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on
we think that you might have could it by helping make shit an everyday word
hm right right
it's true we think that word might be plaguing our friend kenny
do you have any proof of this
no
then  get out of here before we have you thrown out
but we can keep the halo the turtle dolls right
damn crackerass producers
now what are we gonna do chef
i don't know children i guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way
aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh
oh shit
stand aside
alright now we have to get all our biggest names to say shit and then we're gonna
halt your evil plans
huh
i possess the rune stone of undoing who is in charge here
oh  no you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday oh tell me you guys didn't
show your true form geldon lest you be afraid your short time in this world is at an end  ach the rune stone has no effect you are not geldon
i never said i was
you will die anyway for you have spread the word of curse
security
ach  oh
who are you
take this
what are we supposed to do with it
eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
now what
we've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about children we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles knights and kings
lords and ladies we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land excalibur
take a free spin double your odds
'scuse me do you work here
how can i help you noble sir
we need some help identifying an ancient english stone
a what
it might hold the key to a curse
uh i can help get you some credit or a comp meal perhaps
dude we need help from the british
look kid this is just a casino i can't help you you know not every british person knows about wizards  and dragons and curses
we just need help identifying this
the rune stome of gaelic where did you get this
you know what it is
the skire once spoke of such a stone come we must see the sorcerer
get ready for must shit tv starting now four straight hours of pure shit it's all live
hey heh shit heh  ya ain't shit
yeah dude ya ain't shit
this is it my greatest work
cocktails cocktails
these americans wish to see the skire
let us make haste to the inner sanctum
how could you foolish americans bring the wrath of scorn by masschanting the word of wretchedness
uh yeah we didn't mean to
didn't you realize shit is a curse word
well yeah but i don't think that we knew curse word meant curse word
ha leave it to americans to think that no means yes pissed means angry and curse word means something other than a word that's cursed
let me see the stone
but i don't get it people use curse words all the time
saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing it's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place
i've seen this before stones that were used by the knights of standards and practices
knights of standards and practices
a legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay but they were just a myth
you know what you're dumb as shit
oh yeah well i don't really give a shit
ya know that word's kind of getting old it's not really funny anymore
yeah they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon
well they can't use fag because you can't say fag unless you're a homosexual
really so we can't say
no see you got beeped
you mean you have to be a  to say
that's right
well that's not fair i should be able to say fag
hey you didn't get beeped
uh oh
well well well guess we learned something new about you jimbo you freakin' fag you wanna make out or something
oh man i am up shit creek
serves you right shitforbrains
yeah how could i be such a dumb sh
say not the word of curse
what the
holy shit
oh boy this show is really reaching for plot now
the knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum should a curse word ever be let out they would return a rune for each word of curse was made representing each of the eight words that so offended god
look there's the fword
and asshole
i knew it meecrob  meecrob is a curse word god must hate it as much as i do
look at this the writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil geldon  who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power then all the world will be destroyed
all the world destroyed
my house too
oh no
what
tonight is the night of a million shits on hbc it's gonna be said over and over
then we haven't much time we must go
turn off those devices of broadcast
what is going on here stop this shit
we are the royal order of standards and practices
we command you to stop saying the curse word
listen mr shinypants i am the head of this network and i will say shit all i want shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit  shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit oh shit
and now back to must shit tv here on hbc
he is too strong we cannot fight him without the rune stone
my my god sir what have you unleashed upon the world
i didn't know  i didn't know
i i can't follow this shitty storyline at all
wait
oh boy that thing has really got sand in it's vagina
the rune stone point it towards geldon
agh dude lame lame  bummer dudes
what a stupid voice
it's okay the curse has been lifted
yeah we all gotta make sure it doesn't come back
you see we've learned something today swearing can be fun but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems
we're all saying the sword too much
kyle
look gerald kyle's on television
uh huh
the knights of standards and practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum curse words they're called that because they are a curse we have to go back to only using curse words in rare extreme circumstances
and besides too much use of a dirty word takes away from its impact we believe in free speech and all that but keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of english
so please everyone from now on you've got to try and watch your language
yeah
that makes sense
ain't that right
is this still part of the show
we're sorry noble knights of standards and practices  from now on we will obey your laws
see that you do
i'm very proud of you children let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to
yeah and kenny didn't die

well then i don't want my boy there either
so he's a homosexual so what
i have nothing against homosexuals either randy but the big camping trip is next week are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight alone with our boys
you know boys emulate authority figures even if it doesn't turn them gay they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls

people people please you're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice as many of you know i myself went through a homosexual phase but the light of christ showed me how to change just give me two hours with this man and i can convert him back

timmy timmy i told you to put on the hat  you dirty motherfucker
what's goin' on
some kind of gay pride rally
lahlivin' a lie
tom i'm standing out in front of henry's supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting the rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice
those boys have shown me the light i never knew the mountain scouts was a hate group
this is a wake up call to america we cannot turn our backs on gays anymore
oh god they're actually pulling it off
the rally has also caught the attention of old scouts members like steven spielberg director of such films as always and
i salute those boys and their courage i am hereby cutting all my funding to the scouts
the rally has also caught the attention of highpowered lawyer gloria allred
it is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate  i am taking this case on personally
with this kind of support tom these boys are sure to have a victory for gays back to you
thanks chris in other news the fbi has finally caught the child molester known as mr slippyfist  this sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked which we will show you now
here's one and here's another
kenny
oh my god
here look at this one sick sonofabitch here's one right here
alright boys break it up
all rise
in the case of big gay al versus mountain scouts of america due to the overwhelming show of support it is the ruling of this court that the scouts must allow big gay al and all gays into their club
alright yeah woohoo
well we'va all learned an important lesson that just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children straight people do that too
yeah
and furthermore the scout elders will be put into stocks for three days so they can see how it feels to be outcast
hooray yeah yeah
we did it we did it
i did it i did it haha
today is a great day for democracy the scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are  and we all it all to me and these six brave little boys  five brave little boys and now here to take his official oath back in scouts is big gay al
thank you all very much but i don't want this
what's he saying
huh
look i appreciate what you kids did i really do but this isn't what i wanted i'm proud to be gay and i'm proud to be in a country where i'm free to express myself but freedom is a twoway street if i'm free to express myself then the scouts have to be free to express themselves too i know these men they are good men they are kind men they do what they think is best for kids no matter how wrong we think they might be it isn't right for us to force them to think our way it's up to us to persuade and help them see the light not extort them to please don't cut the scouts' funding the scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids that's why i love them i will continue to persuade them to change their mind but this is the wrong way to do it so i am hereby dropping my case and allowing the scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club
uh hooray
hooray hey
so wait did we do good
uh yeah ah i think so
eh we kick ass
come on kids let's go get some ice cream
you can't do this you homophobe

hi jesus it's me
stan marsh
of course i know you my child come in
this guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles my friend kyle thinks he's totally awesome
you're good to bring this to my attention stan cults are a very dangerous thing
i read in the bible that you did miracles too if you could go in front of these people and do your miracles then they'll all see that david blaine isn't so special
the miracle i'm most famous for is turning water into wine
can you do it again
very well i shall perform the miracle behold here you can see ordinary water clear clean okay now turn around  er nuh tur turn around  uh okay now turn back  it is now wine
that's it that's how you did that trick
wuh well yeah
that trick sucks jesus
oh well i guess it worked a little better on people  years ago
dude we have to do something this guy is performing more miracles in denver tonight he's gonna get more followers and it'll be impossible for me to get kyle out

congratulations sister you have heard the noble truth and are now a blaintologist
everyone everyone gather 'round i have great news for all blaintologists and for our new members as well we've just gotten word from mr blaine himself the government has denied our church's request for taxexempt status
but we want taxexempt status
yeah why is that good news
because mr blaine has arranged for all blaintologists members from every city and state to march into washington and demand our right for taxexempt status by committing a mass suicide
mass suicide
mr blaine has said that by killing ourselves in washington we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife
hehehe that sounds good
get your things ready we leave for washington at dawn
did you hear that guys we're finally gonna die
alright stanley you can open your eyes now  this is the hall of the super best friends stanley the headquarters for those who stand for what's right
jesus we've been working hard since we got your distress call
who the kid
stanley i want you to meet some of the super best friends  buddha with the powers of invisibility mohammad the muslim prophet with the powers of flame  krishna the hindu deity joseph smith the mormon prophet lao tse the found of taoism  and seaman with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish
so you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions you guys are all actually friends
more than friends young boy we are super best friends with the desire to fight for justice
we all believe in the power of good over evil except for buddha of course who doesn't believe in evil
wow
jesus come look at this  after your distress call we entered david blaine in the super best friends' computer

i think stan might've been right anyway i think it's going too far i mean if i kill myself it's gonna make my family really sad
yeah i know what you mean i don't wanna die either  i haven't even gotten my pubes yet
i think we should bail if we leave the group maybe other people will get the courage to leave too
that co ugh  that could be difficult brother kyle but alright listen why don't we sleep on it if we decide to leave the faction we can do it in the morning
okay okay you're right  oh uh cartman thanks  cartman  what the hell
i told on yooou i told on yooou
what have you done cartman
this is for your own good brother kyle
you must understand brother kyle twah you know too much about the church if you left now you'd become a danger to our cause
ah and you know what else kyle said um kyyyle he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide that he wouldn't do iiit
cartman you fatass tattletale
at least i'm not the boy in the plastic bubble
the suicide pact will go as planned if we die we all die together
meanwhile at the hall of super best friends
look at that jesus his followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine it appears this david blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared
i knew it
here i have a videotape of his performance the other night
perhaps we should have moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with
moses scan this tape can you tell us the source of blaine's power
give me the information
wow the moses
his magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand wait a minute i'm picking up movement from blaintologists from all over the country
the blaintologists are heading to washington but why
wait a minute at his performance david blaine said something about trying to get taxexempt status
omigod
what
if he gets taxexempt status then he'll become a real religion
he would become unstoppable
meanwhile in the nation's capital blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide
if the government will not give us taxexempt status then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs twah
alright brothers and sisters gather around  it's time to drown ourselves in the reflecting pool  however theah reflecting pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought so to drown ourselves you will need to lie on your stomach face down until you die as such
next
meanwhile at the white house
mr president we can't let them all kill themselves
well we can't give them taxexempt status either karl
heeey george what's gon' on
alright brother kyle it is time for us to die
cartman we've been brainwashed don't you see we don't have to do this
but it's the only way for us to be happy
cartman no
give us what we want or we will continue to die
not so fast david blaine
jesus not again
yes but this time i've brought some help super best friends
buddha
mohammad
joseph smith
krishna
lao tse
seaman
the mass suicide is over blaine and so are you
i don't think so get them
my ice breath should take care of you
kyle kyle
sweet salvation
kyle  oh my god they've killed kenny
you bastards
kyle  oh my god they've killed kenny
you bastards
oh my god they've killed kenny
that takes care of them
now it's your turn blaine
perhaps you need to see some real magic
raaargh
oh this looks like trouble
so long super best fools
kyle
stan
kyle you can't kill yourself
i don't want to kill myself they rigged this thing to fill with water
we've gotta stop that oversized abraham lincoln mohammad  great scott
bliegh  yugh uh okay try again hep
it is too powerful jesus
it seems to have no weakness
there has to be a way to destroy it  jesus to moses
meanwhile at the super best friends league
come in moses
what
we need to know how to kill a giant stone abraham lincoln
um let me think um a giant stone john wilkes booth
you heard him super best friends we've got to make a giant stone john wilkes booth
krishna we're going to need wood for a mold
form of a beaver
i will find sources to concrete  you get the water to mix it with seaman
using the wood that krishna cut down as a beaver jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold
that should do the trick now for some concrete
meanwhile in the ocean depths seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete
seaman  look swallow we should be able to divert the water with that pipe
and so seaman and swallow get to get to work
kyle you have to hold your breath  oh very funny
lao tse bring it to life
using his power of taoism lao tse becomes one with the giant stone john wilkes booth
wagh
it worked now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves
hey i was just about to do it
later at exactly the same location
damn you super best friends
your magic is no match for our powers combined blaine
then i guess you win this time super best fools but i'll be back
goddamnit
it's alright everything is as it should be
oh shut up buddha
our leader he he's leaving us
don't leave us david blaine
listen up everyone  you don't need david blaine to tell you how to live see cults are dangerous because they promise you hope happiness and maybe even an afterlife but in return they demand you pay money any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and learn its tenets is wrong see all religions have something valuable to teach but just like the super best friends learned it requires a little bit of them all
he's right he he's right
thanks for saving us stan you're my super best friend
your my super best friend too kyle
oh that's so sweet you guys  you wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while heheheheheh
haha hehahaha
ah  ow stop it  ah
well it looks like everything worked out
and so jesus and his companions leave washington but their return is assured for there will always be a need for the super best friends

so i realized 'what if we got radiohead to come here to south park' right then they could meet scott tenorman  and  see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony
what
don't you see if i can get this pony to bite off scott's wiener in front of radiohead then scott would cry and if scott cries then radiohead will say scott tenorman is totally not cool and that would make scott tenorman wanna die  okay i'll keep working on the pony you guys go get radiohead to play here ready break

what
yehes i'm afraid this isn't your chili scott i switched it with chef's  it's delicious chef i hadn't planned on that what i did plan on however was that my friends stan and kyle would betray me and warn you that the chili con carnival was a trap  i assumed that they would tell you that i had trained denkins' pony to bite off your wiener what they didn't tell you was that denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight knowing that you would try and do something to the pony i warned mr denkins that violent pony killers were in the area  i also know that you wouldn't go yourself for fear of having your wiener bitten off you would most likely send your parents  and i'm afraid that when mr denkins spotted them on his property he shot and killed both your parents
well they was trespassin' and i was protectin' myself i i have my rights
my mom and dad are dead
i came just in time to see mr denkins giving his report to officer barbrady and of course to steal the bodies  after a night with the hacksaw i was all ready to put on my chili con carnival so that i could tell you personally about your parents' demise and of course feed you your chili  do you like it do you like it scott  i call it mr  mrs tenorman chili
oh my god  oh my god

we're not quadruplets terrance we snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here
oh thank god the last thing i need is more kids  what do you want an autograph or something
nuh it's more important than that our school is putting on a big show for earth day and we promised people we could get you to perform
earth day huh that sounds like a very noble cause how much does it pay
but where's phillip
who
phillip your partner
why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say hey where's phillip like we're freaking married or something you know i'll let you tatertots in on a little secret phillip is a hack  you know who wrote all the terrance and phillip stuff me phillip never did anything but read his lines
but the guy who replaced him sucks
ah i know  i know he sucks  to be honest things haven't been going so well lately i'm not making any money because everyone wants to see phillip why what the hell does phillip do
because dude it's terrance and phillip
ogh whatever  the point is phillip and i are through  and apparently so is the act and so is the money
what if we can get phillip to agree to get back together will you do the earth day show for us
ha goood luck getting phillip he left because he wanted to do  more serious stuff last i heard he was doing canadian shakespeare in toronto
toronto
but we promised the earth day people you'd perform
well in that case i'd say you four boys are up fart creek without a paddle
work work children we only have two more days until earth day work
ah excuse me my daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming
that's not true  global warming is going to kill us all  the republicans are responsible
thank you
oh no dude
oh there you are boys i need terrance and phillip's information so i can tell them their schedule
uuuh we didn't get them

they're not together anymore dude
you'd better be joking we've already announced their participation

you promised us terrance and phillip we therefore promised the world terrance and phillip you will get us terrance and phillip or else
but there's nothing we can do phillip is doing shakespeare in canada now

tom i'm standing in south park colorado where earth day  is in full force  environmental awareness games booths and of course  the entertainment on stage which is being broadcast live all over the country this ecohappy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of terrance and phillip who are promised by these four boys
what a touching and true song you know it's true  republicans are ruining the earth
republicans are ruining the earth
alright well i think i know why most of you tuned in today how about some earth day entertainment
hooray for the earth we must protect it  and now as promised here are terrance and phillip on video
on video
they were considered the best comedy act in all of canada  but a fastpaced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair  this is terrance and phillip behind the blow
wow
what the hell do you call this
eh it's terrance and phillip behind the blow i taped it last month
we promised people terrance and phillip not a video documentary you've ruined the earth for the last time boys
aaaahh
terrance was born terrance henry stoot in the small canadian village of toronto  at a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the canadian school for gifted babies  it was here that he partnered up with phillip niles argyle  a brash young baby from montreal  together they performed musical acts that stunned canadians everywhere  at the tender age of six terrance and phillip were off to the united states to perform on the ed sullivan show  where american audiences would be exposed to canadians for the first time
and now ladies and gentlemen we have two adorable little boys from canada please put your hands together for the music of young terrance and phillip
beef and lamb chicken and ham step to the left and clap your hands gosh we love our chicken and ham don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham
oh my god what's wrong with their heads
it's alright darling they're just canadian
oooh
beef and lamb chicken and ham step to the left and clap your hands gosh we love our chicken and ham don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham
the canadian act confused american audiences  but then something happened that would change terrance and phillip's act forever  it was the birth of canadian comedy  terrance and phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art and meeting some of america's most influential people
excuse me which way is the bus station
hey you're the guy on the screen
what
but it was in  on the sonny  cher show that terrance and phillip finally started to mix their canadian humor with deep political insight
you know cher a lot of us real americans don't know much about canada
well a lot of us real americans aren't as stupid and short as you hm
please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented terrance and phillip
say terrance i'm getting worried aboot all these russians making missiles maybe we should stop this cold war
here's a missile for ya
that's better
with this bold mix of humor and political insight the world couldn't get enough of terrance and phillip  but their fame would come at a price when behind the blow continues
okay okay i think we lost them
jesus man those earth day people don't screw around
kyle none of this would be happening if you hadn't lied in the first place you lied and then you lied to cover up your lie
i didn't see you complaining at the time fat boy
guys we have no choice we're gonna have to move away environmental activists don't use logic or reason
there they are
haaah
aahhh
go run run run
as they entered their late teens terrance and phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success  but the price of fame was looming as terrance and phillip behind the blow continues  the 's and 's were a good time for young terrance and phillip  their act on the donny and marie show earned them a nobel peace prize they were on the cover of every magazine  and then in  even a saturday morning cartoon was made based on terrance and phillip  terrance and phillip themselves supplied the voices
say terrance what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on
i don't know phillip it looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas
oh oh did you say what i thought you said
as leader of the goat people i have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas
wow that sucks
the cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether terrance and phillip were animated characters or real people and so in   the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement a madefortv movie written by and starring terrance and phillip called not without my anus  it was their biggest project to date but it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show the john schneider variety hour  was supposed to air when fans tuned in to see john schneider and instead were treated to the canadian madefortv movie  they were enraged bewildered and scared  the fans revolted and burned down the network killing six television producers and wounding twelve others  the hatred of terrance and phillip had begun terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish  phillip beat up an angry sixyearold fan and was sued for six million dollars it was the first time the duo tasted failure  and it nearly killed them both
what's going on here
sh we're watching behind the blow m'kay
come on kenny hurry up
after years of depression and suicide attempts terrance and phillip finally decided to get together  for one last film  the  hit asses of fire it was one of the highestgrossing films of the summer  and though the film also started the canadianamerican war of   in which eight million people lost their lives the film was considered a great success  after almost being executed by the american government  terrance and phillip were eventually returned to canada  where they were touted as heroes  they have been to hell and back through the very best and the very worst of times together but they had seen it through  and so ends terrance and phillip behind the blow
terrance
oh phillip you're still here too
i was just watching this video i ah you know i've never seen it before
me neither
we sssure did go through a lot together
we sure did
terrance i
no no phillip don't say it i was an asshole and this is mostly my fault
that's what i was gonna say you were an asshole and this is mostly your fault  but you were always the more artistically driven of us i ssshould've put more into it than i did
no phillip i really thought i did everything until i tried to do it alone
think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you carl
ah how
so long boys
wait dude look
thank you everyone thank you you know phillip and i have learned an important lesson that when you go through a lot with somebody you can't let trite things come between you
that's right terrance you should only let trite things come between your asscheeks
ohohoho nohoho
they're back
alright
yes earth day is saved boys everything worked out after all
it sure did
look kenny everything turned out okay
oh well now that's sweet
say terrance can you tell me who farted
he sure did phillip
no i'm asking you his name
and so terrance and phillip got back together proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship
and so it is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to mabel louise cartman  she was a good woman a community leader a caring wife a providing mother  and a loving grandmother
mom it's  this is taking up my whole saturday
ssshhh pumpkin it's almost over
why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day
and now let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how mabel touched our lives

oh but i'm not buying the park to get people to come
you you're not
no no i'm buying it to keep people out  don't you see forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park so that i could be alone in it all day every day i love theme parks  but the lines everywhere you go people crowds  the rides are great but  all the lines lines lines  if there's one thing i hate  all the lines lines lines lines  and then there get to be so many people  that they make fastpass  so then there's lines for fastpass  you stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later then there's lines for the bathrooms  lines for the drinks  lines for cantakuras  and rare kartankulas plinks  and so you see this park is for me nobody else will be allowed in it
nnoh well then i guess i don't feel bad
mr cartman congratulations the theme park is yours
gentlemen i thank you
kyle  dude what are you doing here everybody's looking for you kyle
do you know what happened to me this morning stan this morning i woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass i felt down there and and found this big sore lump on my ass stan i couldn't even sit down so i i had to tell my mother which which was humiliating she took me to the doctor which was more humiliating a a nd he told me ii have a hemorrhoid it's like an infected blood vessel on your ass i'm nine years old and i have a hemorrhoid stan i have a hemorrhoid and cartman has his own theme park
kyle i i understand what you mean but

uh i'm afraid i don't really like rides
but you can ride anything you want and you don't have to wait in line
i'm not interested
dude are you from mars or something any ride you want no lines
if you need security i need a cash salary
but i don't have any cash i spent everything on this park
well look why don't you just let a couple of people in each day every day you can just let two people in charge  per ticket and then you can use that to pay my daily salary
ugh two people
this place is huge you'll never notice two people and then you'll have security for your park
well all alright goddamnit i'll open the park to two people each day but remember anybody else you see trespassing the park
i will shoot on sight

well um ahi found out that cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park i was thinking we could put on disguises and get in
ahahahi'm afraid kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid
jesus
but it's okay stan because i finally figured it out you see if someone like cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park then there is no god there's no god dude
kyle don't say such things
why why mom because if i do something bad will happen to me because if i do your god might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids
kyle yyouyou just don't understand it's

alright folks we've had another change in policy i've had to hire a maintenance person and to pay his salary i have to let in two more people a day  however the stupid maintenance worker demanded i have food and drinks inside the park so now i've had to hire a beverage person and a cottoncandy person which means i now have to let eight people come in a day but you are to try your best not to ride any rides that i am on understood  alright let's go
timmay
wait a minute who are you
mike gainor

goddamnit cartman let me in
i thought you said buying a theme park was stupid security

get him out of here
move along sir
aggh  this isn't over cartman
eugh well now i can finally get back to my riding my rides  uh oh oh man i'm so scared  aaaggghhh
agh  agghh
just a little more  there we go
hello kyle how's the hemorrhoid today
awesome
kyle we wanna tell you about the book of job it's a story from the bible
i've had enough of the bible what has it gotten me
oh i think you'll see differently after hearing this sit down kyle  uh okay  you see job lived in the east of jordan a long long time ago  job was a great man he was blessed with ten lovely children  a wonderful wife and many friends
he was godly and a good man and fed the poor
he was the most upright and honorable of men and every day he praised god
but one day satan went up to heaven and talked to god
satan talked to god
yes in the book of job satan talks to god and god says to satan have you seen job he is a great man and he praises me every day
but satan said oh yeah he only praises you because you gave him so much if you didn't give him those things he would curse your name
to which god said oh yeah i'll show you satan i'll take those things away from job and he will still praise my name
and so god had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter job's oxen and donkeys and murder all his workers
then god sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees
and then as job's sons and daughters were eating god sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all
job was terribly sad but he fell to his knees and said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away and praised god's name
so then job got painful sores all over his body
he was in terrible miserable pain all day every day but he still kept his faith
god said to satan see i told you job still praises me
and that's it that's the end
basically
that's the most horrible story i've ever heard why would god do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to satan
oh uhhh i don't know
then i was right job has all his children killed and michael bay gets to keep making movies there isn't a god
and since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance i have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses need to cover the new ticket guy's salary so that's three more admissions a day  cleanup crew for the bathroom money to cover paint and upkeep  so that's about four admissions  that brings the grand total to  goddamnit  eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today
welcome to cartmanland
isn't he getting any better doctor
i don't understand it he's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all it's like he like he's lost all hope well if you'll excuse me i've got more tests to run
and now back to money quest on hbc
welcome back to money quest  in just over two weeks young financial genius eric cartman  has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands
and the way he did it is with the brilliant you can't come technique for the first several days the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park it made the public crazy so then weeks later when he opened the doors they were lining up around the block simply amazing

i was really happy with this month's book i agree with what bob and linda said
mom dad you gotta see this
not now stanley this is mommy and daddy's book club night remember
but it's supercool
later sweetie  anyway i found myself enticed by steinbeck's imagery
uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry
oh wasn't it i mean the first sentence
red rocket red rocket sparky red rocket
cannery row in monterey in california  is a poem a stink a grating noise  it's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there and
red rocket red rocket
waaah
stanley what the hell are you doing
i'm beating off the dog red rocket red rocket
stanley you go to your room right now
my room why
go stanley  ahaha ahem heheh he he gets very good grades
stanley do you know why you're being grounded for ten months
no
beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company  ah i mean ever beating off the dog is not appropriate ever
why what's the big deal
stanley don't you understand what you are doing
i was doing red rocket to make the dog's milk come out
no stan what you were doing to the dog wasss sexual
huh
you were stimulating the dog stanley what came out of him was his rrandy
well you know when you do that to a mmale the eh eh you make his stuff come out  well jesus haven't they taught you these things at school
what things
sexual education haven't you learned that yet
no
oh look well you see stanley well your school should be teaching this stuff
yeah let's get that damned school on the phone
okay parents i know a lot of you want a chance to speak but we have to talk one at a time
look our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television there's no way we can stop it the schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age
school policy has been to teach sexual education later in the fifth grade
it isn't soon enough
yeah why just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog
look parents do you really want your children learning about sex part of the fun of being a kid is being naive let them be kids for a while
naive at what cost chef parents we have to face facts children in america are having sex at younger and younger ages stds are affecting younger and younger kids all the time the only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex
the first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitchscare tactic about stds
no she's right with all the teen pregnancies that are out today i think my boy does need to know about sexual education  from the school
yeah uh huh yeah we have to
okay boys this is the first day of sexual education m'kay now i know that some of you think this is very funny words like penis and vagina  nuh now stop that m'kay we're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up m'kay  now this is the male anatomy m'kay here we see the testes and the scrotum  stop that m'kay the next person that laughs is gonna get a referral  m'kay now in order to have intercourse the man takes his penis and he hmmm uhh  let's see the man takes his penis and he hm
dude haven't you ever had intercourse mr mackey
well sure i have it's just i was about  at the time so it's been about  years m'kay let's see uh  i'm pretty sure i took thyeah i took the penis and i bu uh what the hell did i do with that damned thing
alright girls even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear you need to hear it
oh we wanna hear it ms choksondik we're excited
yeah we think it's gonna be fun
yeah
fun it's going to be fun well let's start with our first lesson then shall we  sexually transmitted diseases  that's right because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them how fun is that hmmm is that fun
i didn't mean that
today over  americans will contract a sexual disease today twelve thousand more tomorrow and the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say it's not going to happen to me you say oh ms choksondik that happens to girls in detroit in brooklyn but not here in colorado wrong  gonorrhea herpes chlamydia hpv hiv syphilis hepatitis b hepatitis c the list goes on and on these are serious diseases they have serious consequences  you think that sex is about fun and games and love  wrong sex is about disease here's a little picture of herpes
aaahhh
and here's a little syphilis for you
aaahhh
that's right girls here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms
hello there children
hey chef
how is sexual education class going
it's dumb mr mackey doesn't teach us nothin'
yeah i don't think ol' mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy and choksondik i'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life
yeah chef what's laid
oh nothin' now move along children you're holdin' up the line
hey maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed
yeah  hey wendy did you guys get
aaaahhh
what the hell is wrong with them
you guys we just wanna know if you
aaaahhh
stay away from me stan
why
are you wearing a condom
a what
aaaahhh
do any of you have your condoms on
no
aaaahhh
don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease
nuh uh
yuh huh if you don't wear a condom you're gonna get aids
aids
oh jeez ah i don't wanna get the aids fellas
is that what you learned in sex ed
mr mackey didn't say nothin' about that
dude mr mackey didn't know anything about anything
you guys have to wear condoms now please just just go away we don't want your aids
but wendy we don't understand how that
aaaahhh
oh my god dude
uh what are we gonna do huh
dude we gotta go get condoms quick
yeah
can i help you boys
yeah we need condoms
condoms
yeah quick
how old are you boys
why does that matter
hai'll be nine next week
sorry kids i'm not selling you condoms
well why not you want us to get aids
i just don't think kids your age should be
mark we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them
but they're children
would you rather them do it unprotected
yeah you want us unprotected asshole
i just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong
kids are going to do what they do and it's up to us to make sure they're protected
well i'm glad this lady's on our side
i don't think we have any that'll even fit them
sure we do we just got in the new gladiators for kids 'lil mini's they're specially designed for kids under  and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty
fifty uh can't we just use the same one every day
no you have to change it
oh jeez we're gonna have to buy tons of these things
uh thanks so much for letting me come over ms choksondik
oh it's no problem mr mackey it's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway
yeah i've already gone over most of the basics you know uh with the boys but i uh eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls in case i missed anything
well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences we have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex
right oral sex which of course would be
using your mouth on the penis or vagina
penis or vagina right oral sex m'kay
it's just too bad these girls are having sex so young
yeah why duh did you
did i what
well uh how long did you wait before you had uh doobers
well if you must know i'm still somewhat of a virgin  but i'm not ashamed of it i wasn't sought after much in high school or college  i was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses  the only boyfriend i ever had was this attractive popular boy named steven garrett i liked him very much but i found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the super bowl the loser had to go out with me for three days
oh i'm i'm sorry
people can be very cruel anyway i know it's hard to understand
ah actually i understand perfectly i i wasn't exactly the captain of the football team either huh huh hehehuh  anyhow  and then as i got older my my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same that's how i got my nickname in college
your nickname
that guy with the really big head
right
anyway i i sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out mm hm mm
wow i've never met a man who is as sexually unappealing as me
neither have i
well i'm quite happy without sex i mean with all the diseases and problems out there who needs it right
uh not me  huhuh okay
well back to the lesson plan then
right
okay  oral sex
doesn't it give any other directions
nope it looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener  if used properly latex condoms are effective against pregnancy aids and other studzes
uh what are studzes
how the heck should i know  why it's just a little doughnut  hoh it's all gooey
just put it on butters
haa how come i gotta go first
butters will you stop fffilibustering
maaaaaa alright man  ooooh it's sticky
it says you gotta check it for holes or tears
i don't even understand how this thing ooh wait oh i see
don't look at butters' schlong gaymo
i wasn't looking as his schlong i was seeing how to put the condom on
sure
but it won't stay on i i need a rubber band or somethin'
ah i got rubber bands
ow huhuh ow okay eh  ow there okay i think it's on
how do you feel
pretty good
do you feel protected
yeah there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing aand it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can pee in it
alright here everybody  tweek give everyone a rubber band hey somebody's gotta help timmy put his condom on
timmehah
teachers i have some bad news last night i received a phone call from the local pharmacist apparently almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active and now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use
i knew it well at least we scared them enough to protect themselves but now maybe you'll believe me when i say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade
but how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use
kindergarten
kindergarten
we've got to get to the students before they start having sex nunot after
aw now this is getting ridiculous
i have to agree with ms choksondik it's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around
i guess we have no choice
okay children who can tell me what a condom is  yes jenny
it flies around and it's endangered
that's a condor jenny condor  condoms are what we use to stop the spread of stds  yes filmore
can we do fingerpaint
no we can't do fingerpaint you kids wanna get herpes huh how about a nice bucket of aids sound good now pay attention alright i'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom  first of all you remove the condom from its package  then you find which way the condom rolls out  put it in your mouth  and apply  and it's as simple as that any questions
alright girls yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all  pregnancy  that's right since you girls have decided to be sexually active teen pregnancy is at an alltime high you seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a babywell let's watch a little video shall we
snacky s'mores presents the miracle of child birth  the time is drawing close for delivery here we can see the water breaking
eeeeww
later the contractions are happening closer together mom sure is in a lot of pain now we can see the crown of the baby's head stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by mom finally the miracle happens and the baby is born  but mom's not done yet
eeww
she still got some afterbirth to push out of her
aaaaaaaa
that's right
girls girls where are you going
man this condom's driving me crazy
yeah i've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much
yeah but it makes going to the bathroom easier
alright boys i now have all the information i need to teach you the female anatomy hm'kay  m'kay this part here is the vaginal opening  this is where the man puts his eric what the hell are you doing
i'm putting on a new condom i filled the other one up
why are you wearing a condom
so i don't get aids
eric you can't get aids from just sitting around you have to get it from sex
from sex
yes
you mean intercourse with a girl
yes now will you all pay attention please the vagina and the clitoris are on the outside and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye
all this time it's the girls that give us diseases
i knew it girls lie they lie right to your face
now here we can see the interior female anatomy things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
well that does it if us boys are going to live we have to get rid of the girls
yeah come on guys this is war
yeah that's right come on
and here we see the tender magical uterus here we see the enticing voluptuous fallopian tubes m'kay
okay children now i wanna review the different sexual positions who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about
miss'nary position
missionary position good a little boring but tried and true what else
doggie
that's right doggie style we went over mhm
pile driver
uh huh pile driver position good quaid
the filthy sanchez
yes good flora you remembered the filthy sanchez
hot karl
yesyou can give your partner the ol' hot karl sure
there you see the girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out
stay away from us bastards we don't wanna get pregnant
yeah just take your diseases and go away forever
ha they're your diseases
yeah you get out of town
here talk to them butters
uh me huh what the heck am i supposed to say
just tell them that if they leave town peacefully we won't have to resort to violence
just walk away you can put a stop to all this just walk away and we will spare your lives just walk away
man he's pretty good
we'll never walk away never
waaooo
oh bitch
that does it attack
m'kay so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids m'kay
i've already gone through that with the girls  it's pretty simple do you wanna drink
why sure  hey uh i think i can get through that stuff pretty quick mm  uh maybe we should come up with another lesson plan
something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse
uh right right uh like in the nipples
or the shaft of the penis
it says here that the uh head of the penis is actually the most sensitive part m'kay
why yes the nerve endings are the most concentrated at the tip of the penis like they are in the  clitoris of the woman
and these are the two areas most important to
sexual stimulation  oh is this wrong
i don't know it doesn't feel wrong  i've been thinking about you a lot ms choksondik
yeah what do you do when you think about me
i go crazy
do you touch yourself
yeah hmm
haawww haawww
g'oh m'kay
oh my god oh god yeah stop stop
huh what's wrong
it's your turn
mm oh oh ms choksondik okay okay
do you want me
i do
tell me
i want you m'kay
wait wait wait do you have a condom
well no
oh well fuck it  oh god give it to me
oh yeah woh
woh  ooh that's it baby that's it
aw this feels so good m'kay
waaaahhh
waaaahh
what the hell was that
did you feel something
oh no
jesus christ
ooo butters you're in big trouble now
well i don't know what got into you kids you should be ashamed of yourselves
we just didn't want the girls giving us diseases
i'm afraid this is all my fault i think i went a little overboard scaring the girls i forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you have to have sex with them first
oooohhh
well i hate to say it but you all got what you deserved
huh
look schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day but sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams sex is emotional and spiritual it needs to be taught by family i know it can be hard parents but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids you don't know who they're learning it from it could be from someone who doesn't know  someone who has a bad opinion of it  or even a complete pervert
wha why did you pan to me just now what the hell is that s'posed to mean
he's right i never knew how special and personal sex was un until just recently
this whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves
it's easier to just leave it up to the school but it'sjust not a school subject
then it's decided no more condom classes in grade school
hooray
but chef when is the right age for us to start having sex
it's very simple children the right time to start having sex is
seventeen
seventeen
so you mean  as long as you're in love
nope just
but what if you're not ready at
seventeen you're ready
well i guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases huh wendy
yeah thank god
well i guess now that that's out of the way we can get on with our lives come here boy  that's it red rocket red rocket come on now come on red rocket dog red rocket now
okay children so what other sexual positions have we talked about yeah the wraparound butt grab sure can't forget that uh huh reverse cowgirl good kevin hot lunch sure she likes that donkey punch uh huh glassbottom boat good one yes fisheye good jenny chili dog mmhm

let's go let's go
get it
what the
throw it down
oh alright have your way with me if you must go on fulfill you sick pleasures
alright let's go
huh where are you goin'
this is where you came from
yeah i think so  oh man
what
i'm so high right now i have no idea what's goin' on
welcome home smart towel rg
ah hi is this where our okama gamesphere is
we're missing out on some quality video game time right now
thank you for bringing him to us boys you see this is not an ordinary towel he is the rg smart towel designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
we don't care
you see here at tynacorp our goal was to make the perfect towel a towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly
dude we don't care
towelie was our greatest success smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills but then one day towelie got high and just sort of wandered off
we don't care
all we wanna know is who has our okama gamesphere
ah yes your video game i'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap they called you and said to bring the towel and then they called us and said they were bringing towelie back their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop
who's they
why the military you see after towelie got high and wandered off from here the military got a hold of him they wanted to turn towelie into a weapon of mass destruction
don't care don't care don't care
towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his tna but then one day towelie got high and just sort of wandered off again
goddamnit can we please just get back to playing our video game please
i'm afraid not because your okama gamesphere is at their base
can you tell us where that is please
you mean to go right into their base  of course the entry code should still be in towelie's memory banks you could sneak him in there and recover his tna great plan
sir sergeant masters and boll are reporting sir
ah yes  tell me marine did you accomplish your primary goal
sir yes sir all towels have been destroyed the smart towel is no doubt eliminated
ahh and you're quite sure of this
eh yes sir there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles
hmm  so perhaps then you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to tynacorp
oo we
he must have outsmarted us sir
well i'm through playing hide and seek we've got no other choice prepare to blow up all of colorado
in a moment we will be over the base this is the only way in any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts
okay
i hate to send you back in there towelie but only you have their security system in your memory banks
that's alright it's always good to bring a towel
good luck boys the fate of the world is depending on you
we're not doing it for the world we're doing it for our video game god are you deaf
alright boys when you drop from the plane cover and roll got it
yeah
go go go go
dude i figured it out
what
if we can go in and get the gamesphere in  minutes we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight
so that'd be like what eight hours we could play before school
seven and a half
hurry up stupid parachute
alright i think we go over there
let's see  no
come on towelie the guy said you have the security system in your memory banks
hey it's been a long time
you just have no longterm memory 'cause you get high all the time
don't preach to me fatso
i can preach to you all i want 'cause you're stupid
you're stupid
yeah and you're a towel
you're a towel  just let me get high i know i can remember if i get high
oh god damnit alright fine  here's your stupid lighter
hold on  wait a second  that's it
that's it
yeah that's the melody to funky town  won't ya take me down to funky town
no towelie the entry code
for what
goddamnit i guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence
well let's look in here
kill me kill me
oh my god noooo
well well well look what the cat dragged in
what are these things
genetic copies we tried to make with your tna they didn't work too well i'm afraid
kill me
do you have our okama gamesphere
you did very well to get the towel this far boys i wonder what did they tell you at tynacorp that the big bad government wanted to genetically engineer a towelie as a weapon now let me tell you the real story
oh god don't care don't care
yes we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel but only because we had to you see when we started spying on tynacorp we discovered a certain terrifying secret
go on ask him what terrifying secret
what terrifying secret
that tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world
we're never gonna play our okama gamesphere again are we
don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of you get out of the shower and dry yourself off but even after you're dry the towel makes you more dry it keeps getting you drier and drier  can you imagine it what it would feel like to be way way too dry i'll tell you something you don't want to know and i don't know
and we don't care
you've been doublecrossed by tynacorp kids they set this all up to get you in here and take us down
so let me get this straight our okama gamesphere is back at tynacorp
oh yes it has been all along
can i kill the towel now sir
go ahead
no wait  perhaps now we can use their own towel against them these boys must return to tynacorp and we will launch a sneak attack on tynacorp as well  you boys can take the towel to tynacorp's central core and upload this encryption disk into their system bringing them down once and for all
but we don't care
what the hell is this the towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own selfdestruct sequence
the towel has a will of its own it's learning compassion
we don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military and stop those wonderboys from getting to the core
then we have no choice we'll have to test the new prototype a little earlier
don't forget to bring a towel
alright boys take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished  then upload this encryption disk into their computers
we're just going in to get our video game back
if anything goes wrong use this newlydeveloped photon rifle
photon rifle whatever
hello hello anybody here
welcome to the party boys  haaarrrhhhh
oooh ooohh oh boy
haaarrrhhhh
so you thought you could outsmart us did you kids
aaaaarrrr move move move move move move  don't make a move you bastards
bring the towel here boys they can't shoot children
don't listen to them they lied to you before
oh yes boys obey your government well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on
ohmigod look
our gamesphere
aw sweet it still saved our plays
you see boys i'm afraid you were doublecrossed if they were the military why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with because they're not the military
alright maybe we lied to you but it was to protect your own skin we are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring tynacorp down
whoa check it out guys the parachute level
sweet
but perhaps we should show these kids who tynacorp really is made up of go on tell them why you've been making towels zytar
oh there's gold get the gold kenny
our planet was dying we had no choice but to find a new one manufacturing smart towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived
and now you know the horrible truth boys
truth or no your alienmurdering group is over
could you turn it up
boys try to reach the core override we've got no choice but to try to take them all out  i think i can get it from here boys

we realize that but we just thought that maybe someone else had found tommy and then lost him again we're pretty certain that it's our boy considering his physical appearance martha and i have the same condition
riiight
you may not have realized this but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be
really
yes
steven and i have a condition called torsonic polarity syndrome it's a birth defect that's passed on genetically
over eleven people worldwide suffer from tps
hmm hmm that's am that's amazing
martha and i were lucky enough to meet each other at a tps convention in france
so do you have heads down where your rear ends should be
no no don't be silly you see with tps the birth defect is on the exterior only behind this we still have all our vital head organs  tongue eyes nasal passages

ehheh llook if you want an explanation you you'd better go to kenny's house
yeah he lives about four houses away in the bad side of town
oh thank you thank you
well
they said to inquire four houses down
let's hurry
ehheh cartman what the hell are you doing
yeah you missed them turning around
you guys something's wrong
what
i think i just saw the funniest thing i'll ever see and i think i blew a funny fuse
blew a funny fuse
it was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded  i don't think anything will ever be funny again oh god what have i got
you mean they both have butts instead of heads
yeah dude we'll show you they're over at kenny's
how do they eat
how the hell should we know
butters hey butters you have to check this out
wwhat
you gotta come to kenny's house with us
there's these two people with asses where their heads should be
ahahi can't fellas ahi'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture
but dude you gotta see it it's hysterical
butters can't come out and play boys he thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that i have to pay for
huh but i told you mom ahi didn't mean to look like a jackass eh it just happened
you made a goofy face
no that's just what i look like see
don't you make that face at me young man
i'm not makin' a face mom
stop it
come on we wanna see the ass people
alright
fine butters if you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me you can just stay in your room for another week
another week  i hate my stupid face
okay eric as your counselor uh i want you to feel comfortable talking about anything m'kay
mr mackey is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever
well i can't think of anything that would be that funny
two people with asses for heads ever since i saw them i can't laugh at anything
oh i see well well what did you used to think was funny
you know all the usual stuff dirty jokes funny movies seeing someone die  this morning i even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and i couldn't laugh i mean i i knew it was funny but i couldn't laugh
well eric i suppose that just like everything else laughter can be relative  in in other words sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them so the same could be true for funny things
so does that mean i'll never laugh again
it's possible hm'kay  but you know if you have completely lost your sense of humor you can always become a writer for the show friends  ohokahay huhuh
ugh
and so you see our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton
yes yes i see
kenny don't you think you owe the thompsons an apology
no it was foolish for us to get our hopes up
it was just such a coincidence considering the photo you may not have realized this but martha and i have buttocks where our heads should be
really
mr and mrs thompson how long has it been since you've seen your son
tommy disappeared when he was only seven
oh steven it's like it's all happening all over again
there there now
please mrs thompson it'll be alright  listen the south park dairy company is the country's largest we find lost children all the time  we can help you find tommy with the company's database
yes well aaahi'll help you find your son just stop cryin' please for the love of god stop cryin'
ah agh i'm sorry i'm sorry
mr thompson how did your son become missing was he abducted
yes he was in the care of our nanny at the time
the nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why  we think perhaps she wanted a child of her own
and this was back in wisconsin
yes but we last heard the nanny was heading west  that's why we thought colorado made sssssense
we've tried every avenue to find him  but we've never tried the milk company
well you just give us a try i think you'll find that south park milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids  but also the best producer of the freshest  lowfat milk the world can offer
thank you thank you so much for helping us
this certainly is a friendly town  you've all been sssssso wonderful
yes i'm so grateful i just wanna cry again

uh mr and mrs thompson as president of the south park milk company i want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons
please please it's not your fault
yeyes but here at south park milk we strive for excellence for instance we are now entering the extraction room  as you can see we keep it close to the refrigeration room that way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible  that's why some say south park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself
amazing
here try a glass of our cold vitamin d and our fresh scones
delicious
oh excuse me a little difficult to drink with our condition
martha and i actually have buttocks where our heads should be

tps torsonic polarity syndrome child missing since  workiiing
so you actually haven't seen your son in over  years
that's right
but then why did you think the picture of kenny was him wouldn't your son be much older now
yes but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo  we assumed someone had seen him since we did
this is the only photo we have of our little tommy
it's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids
well why don't we let mrs garthunk do her work and i'll take you two out for some good old colorado chili
we don't really like chili it makes us throw up

kindergarten teacher herbert garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money mr garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device which he simply calls it  so what exactly is it  here with a report is a hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel
thanks tom ioh  thanks tom so far herbert garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention he claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it but earlier today hbc news got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look including steve forbes  steve jobs  ted turner  donald trump  bill gates  and yasmine bleeth  their curiosity is piqued tom and so is ours what is it what does itdo and when will it be somewhere where i can buy one reporting live jeff arrando  hbc news

gentlemen imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports
that sounds incredible mr garrison
it is incredible mr hat and what makes it possible  is it's patented gyroscope design  gentlemen i give you it
whoa
nice
sweet
it gets over  miles to the gallon and is safely capable of speeds of over  miles per hour
whoa wow
this will change everything
we're going to have to rethink cities
now it is easily operated using four flexigrip handles two of them are on each side left side for throttle right side for steering  the third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus to keep the driver in place
ugh oh
there we go now the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth as such  put the four together and we're ready to go
oh my god
look at it go
but the way it works do you think people will go through that to travel
hey it still beats what you go through at the airports
true
yup
yeah that's true
yeap
i can't take it anymore stan my cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane
i know dude every kid in school wants to kick his ass
i spent five years in this town making a good name for jews and this this stereotype shows up and wrecks it all you know what my biggest fear is that i'll become him that somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me and i'll become a stereotype i mean i'm a jew and he's making me hate jews
dude a selfhating jew you are becoming a stereotype
ya see
i'm baack
ugh
book later dude
tom the day is finally here it has arrived for retail sale and people are getting their first look at it
okay good just step through here  and then this is your steering and here's your throttle
okay
okay now you're just gonna feel a little pinch
haaaow
it's alright it's just locking you in  you can take it  doing great kathy how's that ride  okay now use your mouth to operate the turn signals and you're off  great who else wants to give it a spin
oh man it that the it
hehyeah
how is it
well ugh ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies that's for sure
i don't know about this guys i think sleds are dangerous
look kyle sledding is something all kids out here do you've gotta learn
it seems like i might get splinters though
remember just hold on no matter how long the sledding run lasts hold on
hold on i see  oh jeezus this sled is going faaaast
hang on
i have to watch out for my glasses ow ow it's so cold oh jesus
how far do you think it is to connecticut

he's faaahn
are you tired of corporate airline companies treating you like a worthless sardine  tired of ridiculous lines and horrible security at airports  well now there is an alternative to airline travel  it  it has taken the country by storm  and already two million have been sold  never have another important business trip ruined by airline incompetence  hey ladies how did you get to the grand canyon  it comes in sizes for the entire family
here you go robby
hello i'm john travolta i used to rely on airlines to get me to set but once i got used to it  i found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies i just power up the flexigrips  and i'm ready to go thank you it
so join the millions of americans who have felt a little more comfortable with traveling  order yours today and remember our slogan it's better than flying
hm that was pretty gay
kyle two where is kyle
i don't know mom last time i saw him he was sledding
where on earth could he be
you know it's just possible he went back to connecticut
what
well ah i mean maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her
don't be ridiculous kyle two he's out playing with his new friends
i'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility
i'm baack
aaa
i'm sorry you must've been worried sick i got your sled tangled up with a bus
a a bus rreally
kyle what happened to you
ah i was just sledding and the next thing i knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus uh i gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas  i'm sorry about your sled kyle
oh no don't worry about it dude
oh you poor thing come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes  are you alright
oh my ears feel like they're frozen off and i think i have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long
we're in the money mr hat we're in the money mr hat  oh hi jimbo can i help you
yeah i wanted to order that theft alarm for my it
oh right right take a seat
uh that's okay i'll stand
what do you think mr marsh all set to put a down payment on that baby
well yeah but i have one question about the way it works
sure
well  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle
yeup
well so they don't really do anything
right
so then couldn't i just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth
well i guess you could
huh
whazzat
wha what did you what did he say
what
i don't know about this guys i think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous
kyle we told you kids in colorado all play hide and seek at the airport
yeah as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is
ungh this is taking too long the flight to connecticut is about to leave  ey can we speed things up here
daaah sorry but ever since that it thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees
dude we're the only ones here how long does it take five people through security
derr let's see twelve people plus times divided two hours domestic three hours international
can't we just play hide and seek at home
no
dah ha what's this a toenail clipper  die terrorist
oh jesus
see we do these checks for a reason
this is ridiculous come on
okay cartman you're it start counting

here kyle you go hide in here
in there but it's very confined i'll get cramps in my legs

yeah he'll be waaay better off back at home
oh jesus this bus is going fast  oh i did it again
excuse me what the hell are you doing
it's alright we're with the government
we're just shutting you down
shutting me down why
the airlines are in desperate trouble your vehicle is causing them to lose money
yeah well that was the point dingleberry aht put that down
right so the government is bailing the airlines out again by shutting you down and making its illegal
oh goddamnit you'd better be kidding
sir many people work for the airlines we can't let them all be fired
the airline companies are losing money because of their own incompetence and their own inefficiency
that may be true but if you build sell or ride another it it will be the last time have a nice night
hwaaaahhh airline motherfuckerrrs you pieces of shiiit cocksucking sons of bitch airlines

don't you worry kenny i i'm gonna find a cure for you everything's gonna be okay
cartman
oh kyle hey what's goin' down jewboy
cartman were you crying
' no no i mean i i got somethin' in my eyes it's this uh the air in here is just uh  oh man
hey cartman  i care a lot about him too
i'm gonna find a cure kyle i swear to god i'm gonna find a cure
sure you will cartman sure you will
this is where the bulk of our research was being done but due to the government ban we're mostly just packing things up
doctor can you tell me exactly how stem cells work
look you have trillions of cells in your body heart cells skin cells brain cells and so on but before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell it's what we call a stem cell sort of like a blank cell do you understand
not at all but go on
because these cells are blanks they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them you see this rat earlier this year we surgically removed the middle of her spine then we injected her with some stem cells and they became the missing part of the spine
my god
nerve cells damaged by parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells
so then could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away in other words if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease the stem cells could become new muscle tissue
that's the theory
well so then if the stem cells are placed nest to s shakey's pizza they would become another shakey's pizza and you'd have your own shakey's pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat
well no to build another shake's it would be better to use lumber
hmmm
but unfortunately the government has banned stem cell research and so we'll never know
looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind
where are you going
there's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now doctor i'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves
hey kid  give 'em hell give 'em hell
oh doctor  thanks thanks
oh hey kid  good luck good luck
oh and doctor ah never mind
and see here's one from butters it says we can't wait to see you back in school kenny and it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane

stan sometimes god takes those closest to us because it makes him feel better about himself he is a very vengeful god stan he's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago he just can't get over it so he doesn't care who he takes children puppies it don't matter to him so long as it makes us sad do you understand
but then why does god give us anything to start with
well look at it this way if you want to make a baby cry first you give it a lollipop then you take it away if you never give it a lollipop to begin with then it would have nothin' to cry about that's like god who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears you see it's our tears stan that give god his great power
i think i understand
my name is eric cartman and i live in colorado my best friend in the whole world is kenny mccormick and he he's sick right now he's real sick he's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live look i realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject but all i know is that if there's a chance a chance that stemcell research could save my best friend's life well i guess i owe it to him to try and change your minds  i love kenny mccormick and  i want you to love him too  and i uh i'm not the best speaker in the world maybe i can put it best in the words of a timeless song it was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meantthe heat of the moment shone in your eyesi never meant to be so bad to youone thing i said that i would never do
one look from you and i would fall from grace
and that would wipe the smile right from my face
do you remember when we used to dance
and incidents arose from circumstance
one thing led to another we were young and we would scream together songs unsungit was the heat of the momenttelling me what our hearts meantthe heat of the momentshone in your eyes
and so you see now that the ban on stemcell research has been lifted we can sell your fetus to companies like alder labs
oh i don't know
look i can offer you seventyfive dollars for that fetus right now jill
seventyfive dollars well alright
great just sign right here please  hi havin' an abortion today  great  listen if you'd like to sell your abortion for research i'm offering uh seventyfive dollars help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there  and you sign right here  uh excuse me ma'am can i interest you in selling your aborted fetus
we're not going to the abortion clinic i'm going to have this baby
oh i'm sorry to hear that because uh there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could the stem cells from your fetus could help save his life
oh well i guess we can always just make another one
oh mark i love you
alright now kenny has a fighting chance
young man do you know where you're going
yeah i'm gonna see my friend because he needs me right now
all right
go kid
good for you
hey kenny  oh no  no
he just he just stopped breathing and it was over
but  i didn't get to see him hell i i didn't get to sssay goodbye  did he say anything before he went
he just said where's stan
and so we will all miss kenny his playful laughter his innocent smile but we will never forget that it was because of brave kenny that stemcell research was allowed to continue
i let kenny down i'm his worst ffffriend
you guys come quick
what cartman
it's  why it's a miracle you guys
what cartman what's happened
look  i put the stem cells from all the fetuses i had next to a shakey's and they are replicating a new shakey's  it worked
this whole time you were just using kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses
stupid fetuses it's my own shakey's
i actually hugged you i held you in my arms and and cried with you
i think i only need a hundred or so more aborted babies  and i can finish up the kitchen
aaargh
aah kyle  kyle
hey i wasn't kenny's worst ffffriend  cartman was

every year it's the same your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short  i've just got to outdo him this year i've just got to
dad's a good shopper all right
butters maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me
you mean spy on him uh but ain't that kind of like fibbin'
no it's a little different you remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector
sure i do
why i think inspector butters could find out what daddy'd getting mommy without him ever knowing  what do you say
inspector butters in on the case ma'am
everyone know it's butters
uh that's me
hm dad's going to see a movie how nice
white swallow bath house

i'm back ma
oh hi sweetie did you get to follow your dad around
i sure did  dad sure had a nice night out
well did you see what he got me for our anniversary
well first he went to see a movie
a movie hmmm i wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself
i don't know but it wasn't the movie theater at the mall no it was that really old theater downtown the studcat  i didn't know it was open
wait a minute what was the movie called
fisting firemen   i've never seen  through
oh my god
uh but it must have been a real short movie though because dad came out like ten minutes later and it must have been a sad film too because he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out poor old dad the movie really got to him
butters where did daddy go after the movie
to the gym
to the gym
yeah the white swallow spa
gaah
yep he went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys he wasn't too good though this one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight
butters are you sure about this you have to be absolutely sure
inspector butters gets all the facts i even got some neato pictures  the only thing i can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'  oh did you have a nice trip mom see you next fall hahaha yo ma
butters
uh that's me
paaiint must paaiint everything clean paaiint

everyone knows it's butters
that's me
butters oh butters could you come and see me in my study real quick
uh hey dad
come here son  i wanna have a talk with you
well sure thing dad
son i wanted to talk to you about lying
well i know lying's bad dad yyou told me so
yes it sure can be  but there are also times when distorting the truth a little uh is appropriate these are called little white lies
little white lies
you see sometimes telling a little white lie is okay like for instance when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house
uh who's jack
butters the point is that i think that if you told mommy what daddy was doing tonight well she might go completely insane
oh no that won't happen dad
it won't oh good
eh no because i already told mom and she's fine
you what
butters mommy wants to take you for a little drive now
a drive oh boy  i i love a good drive is dad comin' too
no sweetie daddy needs to sit and think
alright see ya in a bit dad  oh boy a drive
oh jeez you wouldn't have believed how angry i was when teacher said i had to share my fingerpaints because i've been sharin' them all along
butters you know that mommy loves you an awful lot don't you
well sure i do mom i love you too
and sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies but it's really for the best
oh you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' nutsack in front of grandma yeah i need to behave myself
if a mommy has to end her life she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert
well sure that makes sense i suppose yeah hey did you seen my mittens anywhere  it's cold out here
i'm going to get out of the car now butters  i want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened
oh well alright mom oookay then  you know i think the car might be movin' mom  yep i'm pretty sure the car is movin' looks like i'm headin' for the water
shhh shhh it's okay baby mommy will be with you very soon

naw linda because you can't now say that the abductor is costa rican  you have to learn to keep it straight
i can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story
hey don't forget that i'm covering for you
don't forget your lies started all this
my lies may have been deceitful but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything i ever did
happy anniversary
not now butters
oh  alright then i
butters oh butters
son i don't believe it
ah i'm sorry the car just rolled into the lake and it floated all the way down the river i tried callin' home but it was
oh my baby's back
i ain't grounded am i
nohuih no butters oh son why  oh uh we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though alright
lie
oh eh yes uh darling you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home
no you have to say that a puerto rican man dropped you off
ohhh who's gonna believe he just dropped him off
hey you stop hollerin' it's your anniversary
now we don't really have a choice do we
you're the one that made up the stuff about the puerto rican idiot
uh stop it mom and dad
well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description stupid
now gosh darn it you  you listen here now i am sick of these harmless lies and llittle white lies you know you can call a shovel an icecream machine but it's still a shovel mom and dad ah and you can call a lie whatever you want but it's still a nogood stinkin' lie and when you start coverin' up one lie with another why now that's when you get into real trouble  boy i've i've just about had it up to here  with you two
butters you're as right as rain
you sure are
well i ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya am i
no butters you're the best son in the whole world  and i am so happy you're alive
well ah i'm happy you're alive too mom so now can we go to bennigan's
you bet son but mommy and daddy have something they have to do first
we have an announcement to make um our son has been returned to us
wow alright
butters was missing
but that isn't all we have to say you see we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us
yeah
we've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean
yeah
you see i've been deceiving my wife for several months i was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers
ye  wait what
huho
and when i found out i went crazy i went crazy and i drove my son into the lake to kill 'im
uh kkill me uh jesus christ
damn dude
so you see there was no some puerto rican guy he doesn't exist and so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the ramseys congressman condit and oj we gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and we're sorry now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets for i knew that even though some of you supported us some others were looking at me and thinking you're a liar you're a liar  you know somethin' that you're not telling us you slimy scumbag liar  eh you know that's what people would say to me and then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say hello but they'd be thinking ah there goes that murderer  you got away with murder you murdering lying waste of life  and to me people might say things like  liar tell us what you know you goddamned liar  and so to both of us people all over town would be saying things like  you know goddamn well what happened to your kid so stop acting like victims and confess you murdering murderers  confess  liar confess  you know and that's what people would be saying to us and so we just had to come forward and tell the truth
we're sorry we lied to you all it won't happen again
and now if you'll excuse us this family has to get to bennigan's
yeahahalright
wow dude your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you
yeah boy you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now
we sure are
i really wish i didn't know that stuff i guess i learned that sometimes lying can be for the best yup oh well when i want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at bennigan's i forget all about my dad bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me i'm gonna be okay

oh dude look  it's that commercial with the guy that lost  pounds eating at subway sandwiches
he's still lookin' goodhis name is jaredhis name is jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches
uh hey fellas
hey kenny
now gosh darnit my name's not kenny kenny's dead and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it
okay notkenny
hey south park  you can meet jared in person march  at the kenny mccormick memorial town square
woh boy jared's comin' to town
dude that's today
we've gotta get down there come on notkenny
now gosh darnit my name's not notkenny
okay come on notnotkenny
woah i'm getting steamed now
hello city wok city wok i take your order prease
excuse me could we get through here
hell no i've been savin' this spot for six hours his name is garrison mr garrison he lost ten pounds takin' jared's lead
here he comes
he's still lookin' good with all those sub sandwiches
thank you all so much you know what after a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches i've proven weight loss is easy  and i promise you i will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss
alright
that guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight he is so cool
mr vogle some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich
sure let 'em in  hi kids
wow jared
dude did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches
i sure did and well well i i also had a little help on the side
what kind of help
well eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it but the way that i lost so much weight was that i got aides
a aids
that's right i got aides about two years ago and i've been losing weight ever since it's amazing how slim you can get with aides
i'll bet you can
would you like to meet them
them
my aides scott tyler  scott is my personal trainer  and tyler is my dietitian
hello
oh a i d e s aides
yep hooray for aides
well that's not really what you say in the commercial
i know you kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen it says i only ate a halfsized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides
but you're lying to people if they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want you might not be so popular
y you think so well why should it matter
it matters dude
hmmm
that penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches he lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised
yeah it's only in america that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass
ohmygod  you guys i think i'm having a genius moment yes yes its coming to me now
tha that's diarrhea
noo don't you see what this all means anybody could do what he did what's to stop someone else from going to say city wok and cutting a deal with them say they'll eat nothing but their chinese food but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise
then city wok could say their food makes them lose weight
that's right stan  it's a cash cow i tell you
that's a great idea
lose weight and make money i tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that butters has ever done
me
weh who do you think i'm talkin' about butters joyce de witt
oh no i thought you meant you eh you're the fat one
i can't lose weight butters 'cause i'm not fat i'm bigboned you can't slim down bones stupid
but butters isn't fat
that's my whole point first we fatten him up then we make the deal with city wok then take the weight back off
he's right if butters is naturally skinny he'll be able to take the weight off faster
but fellas if i get fat my parents will ground me
oh come on just think about how famous you'll be
you mean like jared
yeah dude you'll be just like jared
well the heck with that you said jared was a penisbutt
you wouldn't be a penisbutt butters you'd be famous just think about all those people following you around singing songs to you just because you lost some weight his name is butters it's butters
he used to be fat but not no more
city wok brought him down to a size
now he's got lots of moneys and girls
and a lifetime of free food at city wok
wow
christine you know i love you very much and i i can't wait for the wedding
i love you too jared you've changed my whole lifeher name is jonez christine jonezshe lost forty pounds when she met jared
yeh i know i know i know but uh some young boys were talkin' to me earlier and it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something
jared what's this all about
uh christine this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all but i have aides
what
yeah i have aides i've had aides since before we were together  what what are you thinking are you bummed
am i bummed  you've had aids all this time and you knew it
well of course i knew it
why the hell wouldn't you tell me
i didn't think it was that big of a deal
not that big of a deal i slept with you
aren't you overreacting a little bit
well jesus christ we're supposed to get married
we can still get married christine i mean sure they're my aides now but after we get married they'll be our aides  you'll love having aides christine you really will and when we have children they'll have aides it'll make things so simple  christine  jeez those boys were right people really don't like aides i'd better tell everyone the truth
hello there children
chef we need butters to gain about fifty pounds fast
fifty pounds why
uuuh school project
well if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible one of you will have to marry him
marry him
it definitely worked for every woman i ever met
oh no no no i ain't gettin' married my parents will ground me
yeah none of us wanna marry butters
well uh how come what's wrong with me
well i guess we're gonna have to do this the oldfashioned way come on back children
ugh  wuh wuh i can't eat no more
you have to here have some more mayonnaise
chef we need more food
i'm runnin' out children
damnit butters keep eating or i'll kick you till you're deader than kenny
dude that isn't cool you shouldn't joke about kenny being dead enough time hasn't passed
so how long until we can joke about it
twentytwo point three years that's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny
wugh that's a long time to wait
wull i can't eat no more ii just keep pukin' it up
then eat your puke
no
oh come on japanese girls do it
ladies and gentlemen we at subway are happy to inform you that jared has elected to stay in south park in order to speak to you once again
he's going to speak with us once again
so here he is jared
he's still lookin' good eatin' them sandwiches all the time
thank youhoo thank you all subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight
all right
but  i feel like i need to come a little clean about something uh it wasn't just subway sandwiches that made me thin
huh
the reason i was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that i got aides
huh
what
did he say aids
but i still wanna be the leader in a fitter america and so i'm here to tell you that you should all go out and get aides
oh my god
is he serious
having aides  is  awesome with aides you can literally watch the fat melt away and with the proper mix of aides and subway sandwiches anything is possible
uh the opinions expressed by mr vogle are not necessarily those of the subway company

all right
sir we are in business
jared first of all we want to say that all of us here at subway appreciate everything you've done for our company
well i appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me
yes well it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your strange theories on weight loss elsewhere
'scuse me am i being fired
jared it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health
how so
well your new slogan for instance  when it comes to fitness subway goes hand in hand with aides
ahhah
his name is jared jared lost weight eating subway and sandwiches of
come on butters you gotta get skinny again  you are such a flabby hunk of crap look at those jelly rolls jelly rolls i tell ya you still got seven chins boah you'll never be thin nobody loves you
wuh hey now they do too uh my mom and dad  love me even if i am fat
butters i'm just trying to offer some motivational help here

i never asked to be famous now everyone hates me i almost wish i had never gotten aides
hey now come on what kind of talk is that
i'm sorry guys but ii think i wanna be aidesfree for a while

yeah maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides
wait a minute you're right  yeah i think i know how to be a celebrity again
did you bring the camera
yeah we're all set
guys i think this might be a good time to discuss some business
well what do you mean
well when city wok sees how skinny butters is they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial they're gonna want several
that's true jared did like a hundred for subway sandwiches
i think we're looking at a nonexclusive twoyear fiftypicture deal here my calculations put that at about four million dollars
wow
now i think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us except that i should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea
hey fellas
butters what the hell are you doing
yeah you're still fat
well i know ah i can't seem to lose it
well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today you fat piece of crap

well uh yeah but ah i don't know
why are you doing this to us
all prepared for liposuction surgery
check
uh i don't know about this fellas

'cause it has aids  aids so funny
well so much for our money
yeah but you know i've learned something today it would have been wrong to exploit butters' weight loss because then lots of fat people would have believed it and then gone and eaten a ton of chinese food instead of dieting properly they'd still be fat and we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams
yeah i don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams besides i'd get grounded  oh jesus i'm supposed to be grounded

thanks for having us all over for dinner chris and linda
yes it was fabulous
oh we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little butters
yeah we figure that if our boys are goona be great friends we should all get to be friends too
friends by default
well our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately i think ever since their friend kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void
well our son is a perfect voidfiller it's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies
look you guys butters is asleep
he's such a douchebag
hey have you guys ever seen this trick  when someone's sleeping you can take a glass of warm water  and you put their hand in it
yeah and then what
and then you pee on it  hehehheheheheheheheh
no dude you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee
oh really oh well heh heheheheh heh
and we were thinking since they've all become such close friends how great it would be for us to all go together to aspen for a ski weekend
aaspen uuuh we we can't really afford that
no you see linda and i found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in aspen if you attend a timeshare presentation
they let you stay for free
yes and all we have to do is attend a thirtyminute meeting
well that sounds like a good deal
sounds good to me let's go this weekend
oh boy skiing in aspen i can't wait
hey boys we're all going to aspen for the weekend
all right
wow a ski trip with my new best buddies  oh i'm all sticky
here we are everyone
oh this is gonna be so much fun i haven't skied in years
where are butters and eric
they're still asleep
butters eric come on we gotta get to the powder
hello folks i'm phil and this is josh  we're with the aspen timeshare company
hello
you folks enjoying the condo
it's lovely thank you
you guys you guys you're not gonna believe this this is so funny
what
so last night while butters was asleep i gave him a hitler
what's a hitler
you know when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little hitler mustache you've never hitlered anyone
no i never have
shhshh here he comes
goooood mornin' fellas all set to go skiin'  ahuh uuh uh what's so funny
nothing butters right guys
well we can't wait to show you what aspen timeshare is offering investors shall we do our thirtyminute meeting
oh do we have to do it right now
well best to do it and get it out of the way
okay
boys we have to go to this timeshare presentation real quick but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill
okay
we'll meet you boys on the slopes
hey do you guys smell that
smell what
ehh it kind of smells stinky in this condo
i don't smell anything do you guys
do you guys smell that it smells bad out here too i'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo
yeah well that why they call is asspen
all right little dudes  great to see you out here my name is thumper and i'm gonna be your cool ski instructor
his name is thumper
we're gonna take it slow take it easy make sure everybody has a goood time 'cause what is skiing about having a good  time that's right now just a few safety things to keep in mind first of all look straight ahead when you ski you look down you're gonna fall you're gonna have a bad time also be aware of skiers around you you run into another skier your skis are gonna cross gonna have a bad time
so where's the part where we have a good time
hey little dude you got some crap right here
wuh that's my face sir
alright we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions to go slow we wedge our skis together  in the shape of a slice of pizza then to go faster we put 'em parallel like french fries  you see that  pizza  french fries  pizza  french fries
ahhey this is gonna be just like eatin' at shakey's huh fellas

peeza fron fries peeza fron fries fron friiiies  peeeezaaa
okay you see what he did he frenchfried when he should've pizza'd you frenchfry when you pizza you're gonna have a bad time
and so we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in phase
that sounds like a great investment opportunity
ii'm sorry but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo
yeah and to be honest we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal
oh i know that's what everybody says  not me i can't afford it but what if i told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars
wow
for only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here
well you see timeshare means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  you  share the condo with other investors and pick the  time you want to stay
share  time  time share
so then it's not really ours
sure it is one twentyfourth and a half yours you see timeshare has made it possible for even workingclass people like you to say i've got a little place in aspen
try it try saying it i've got a little place in aspen
i've got a little place in aspen

tom i'm standing in front of the house where three insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twentythree live infant cattle
hey look some other kids are doin' the same thing we are  eugh
several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful tom and the crisis is intensifying here's what some people have to say
we were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion i mean to think this could happen right here in our own community
we gave those kids everything and they turned into little john walkers
the police chief of south park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists
oh no eh this is bigtime trouble now fellas
no this is exactly what we wanted
it is
yeah don't you see this validates everything that we're doing if we're making the news then this is obviously important to people
tom it looks like i have an update yes it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone uh nothing else was going on tom so this was the only story we had to make seem important but people are just simply tuning out so hbc will now be switching programming once again to puppoies from around the world
i don't believe it
ehuh the chinese puppy's my favorite so far
butters buhbutters you have your arm around me
oh sorry i thought you were mr pickles
we must help the helpless we must save the unsaved

you're giving them a missile
stand down ma'am stand down this is a delicate process i've almost earned their trust
stan's getting worse you guys
mike speak
how are we doin'
we got a real sick kid here mike did you get the other things for us
weh ah i did manage to get the fda to officially change the word veal to tortured baby cow
good good
but i couldn't get you north and south dakota
oh mike breakin' my balls mike
now now please can can we get you to come out
all right everythng has worked out the boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them
yes all right woohoo
whoops sorry i doubted your abilities mr negotiator
they're coming out now
yes all we need to do in return is get a cattletransporting semitruck that will take the boys and the cattle to denver international airport where we have a fullygassed airplane waiting to take them all to mexico
what
and they want the guy that plays mr worf on star trek to drive the truck  in full makeup
jesus christ
all right that does it you are in fact the worst negotiator i've ever seen in action
all right all right i'll give you that but in return i want three staples
get out of here  we'll get them the semi and we'll get them the worf guy if they see that thay'll come out and then we could take them
but isn't that dishonest
maybe so but if we don't do something soon there could be fifty even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner are you prepared to let that happen
all right where is mr dorn
i was woken up at three in the mornng told i had to put on makeup and come to this town  what the hell is gong on
i'm sorry mr dorn it's fbi business we've got terrorists making demands and we need your help
this is highly unusual
all right boys we have your truck and we have an airplane on the tarmac at denver international
and worf
my name is michael dorn i play a character called worf
stan it worked
it did
they got us a truck and an airplane and mr worf the calves are gonna be okay
pick me up i i want to see
step back tell those men to step back
do it
mmrrrr
all right woohoo yeah
aw shut up you freakin' hippies  alright mr worf start the engine and put her in gear oh amd you must refer to me as captain
where am i supposed to drive to
no see must say captain where am i supposed to drive to
captain where am i supposed to drive to
you're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves
this whole thing is ridiculous
captain this whole thing is ridiculous
captain this whole thing is ridiculous
okay all set
tom it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi this is still very uninteresting news tom
okay cartman
step on it mr worf
all right
we're going
mexico here we come
wait a minute they're following us full speed mr worf
we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads
captain we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads
captain we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads
alright mr worf then reduce speed to fortyfive and maintain distance from those police cruisers
stan we're almost there you've got to hold on
alright they're in front of the cattle ranch hit it
oh it's a doublecross
alright boys the game is over get out of the truck with your hands up
oh no no
what are you waiting for go kill them worf
i'm not killing anybody
egh some goddamned klingon you are
we're sorry cows we tried we tried
alright boys just stay right there until your parents arrive
can i go now
here you go mr rancher i got your cattle back for you
oh  well it doesn't matter now
what you do mean
you see in the six days since the word veal was officially changed to little tortured baby cow the market has gone dry seems that people see little tortured baby cow on their menus they don't feel like orderin'
really
yep damn things ain't worth spit now i'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life
do you hear that stan it worked we've shut down the veal industry  stan stan
he's very lucky you got him here when you did he was in a very advanced state of vaginitis
vaginitis
it occurs when a person stops eating meat those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas if we hadn't stopped it in time stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy
whoa dude
we've got an iv of pure beef blood pumping into stan's veins and the sores are fading
thank god we stopped it in time
well i guess we learned somethng today it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas
hear hear
all right boys it's time to go home you've got some serious grounding time to start
i'll say
aw we're still grounded
but but we we learned things and took up a cause
yes kyle but you still defied your parents and you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer
that's right let's get these terrorists to their rooms  but first  maybe we can grab some burgers
all right
this is gonna be so awesome
do we have everything
chips pop cookies kleenex toilet paper flares  we won't have to leave the tv room for anythng
all right

hehey fellas i'm glad you called me there was a pieeating contest down at the firehouse and i thought we should all go
butters could you take a seat please
wuh well sure
butters we have to have a very difficult conversation
wull what is it
well in the in the months since our friend kenny died you've really stepped up as a friend and filled the gap
well uh it's my pleasure i love bein' you guys' new friend
yes well butters it's just not working out
not working out
i'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go as our friend you're just tooo
lame
lame yes
well but ah i can get better
butters you just don't really fit in with us here we think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere
but we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend lame as they were
huh but ah i thought we were gettin' along great heh ah i thought we were really havin' fun together
yes well we weren't
please fellas uh don't fire me
we're sorry butters  our mind is made up
but we certainly wanna thank you for coming by  you know the way out right
phew
phew
hm i think he took that pretty well i think
who cares
all right so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take kenny's place
the world isn't fair i do everything people ask me to i stand in the lunch line for them i buy tampons at the store for them i go on maury povich with balls on my chin for them  and yet nobody accepts me i am an outcast a shadow of a man who can find no companion ship no love from others  fine  if i am to be an outcast so be it  i'm through doin' what others tell me to do and i am sick of this world and the stin and the stinky people in it  from now on i will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me  i will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen  where i go destruction will follow
prepare o little town uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen professor chaos
butters time for bed
huuh okay mom  yes uh sleet sleep for now  tomorrow the chaos begins
all right we wanna thank everybody for coming this is a great turnout  uh as you know our friend kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend now you've all been selected as possible candidates but unfortunately there is only room for one of you so stan and kyle and i will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down until we think we've found the perfect friend are there any questions
what if we don't want to be your friend
clyde  okay now the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten and so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped so put on your best friend faces and may the best friend win oh and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee
order twentythree is up and uh order twentyfour is up
uh waitress aaactually i ordered the chicken soup this is minnestrone
yeah i had the minnestrone over here
i am professor chaos and now this puny world uh will bow down to me
so today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends  it was a really fun time we rode all the rides and everyone got along great
i think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was jimmy
well the the reason i think i would make the perfect foreh friend is that i love telling jokes you know who doesn't like to laugh
tweek now there's an interesting choice tweek has a lot of qualities that i look for in a friend
what if they don't pick me what if they get us all man i mean christ if they can get to the pentagon then they can get to us all man aaaa
i think i deserve to take kenny's place the most because i've been hanging around these guys for like five years and i never get to say or do anything
yeah i've only seen that kid in class but he never does anything he's more like a prop
towelie is a tough choice because  even though i can see how always having a towel around can come in handy he's just always so high
man i really hope i win because wait why is this again i have no idea what's goin' on
we decided to get some oneonone time with jimmy and ride the log ride  the great thing was that because jimmy's crippled we got to go to the front of the line  that was definitely big points for jimmy you know but but then we got to the ride itself and
hey ii'm gonna need some help getting in the log fellas
o shut her down someone needs assistance
oh really  that's gonna cost some points
but right now i'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend i i have to pick timmy because timmy doesn't tell any jokes
boy isn't this great fellas are we great pals or what
one thing for sure picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy
kneel kneel before professor chaos
ah the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup i love bringing chaos  and that's only the beginning
all right everyone it was a tough decision but based on our time with you all at the amusement park we have whittled our choices down to ten  if you receive a rose please stay if you don't get the fudge out  kyle will you announce the people we want to stay
token  clyde  craig  timmy
timmih
oh man this is too much pressure
pip  jimmy  jason  towelie  luigi
just one more rose left kyle who does it go to
tweek
aaarr
all right the rest of you thanks for coming get the fudge out
i didn't make the cut oh god i didn't make the cut
i didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me
all right congratulations to those of you selected to stay in the end one of you will be the new kenny  good luck
good morning butters
it certainly is mother did ya hear about what's been goin' on some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot bennigan's

you know that big statue in the town square of pioneer john wesley powell i snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh and i cut off his head  hahahahaa yeah
oh uh
hahaha and they're probably just realizing that now quick we must turn on the news
but hillary clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger  also in the news tonight a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the powell statue in the south park town square
look look i've made the news ii've wreaked havoc
the head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads
i finally made the world sorry i've brought sadness aand chaos
this act of course reminded us all of the time that bart simpson  took the head of the springfield statue in one of their classic episodes here's what some people had to say
well i i think whoever took the head was really just doing an homage to the simpsons  heh i think it's great
yes it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh
well the simpsons is such a great show and we need reminders like this to keep us watching
oh uhm son of a bitch
the police say that instead of looking for the missing head they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the simpsons every day
well why didn't you tell me the simpsons already did that
you seemed so proud i didn't wanna bum you out
stupid simpsons
hello there phillip i brought you something
oh what is it
see we're just watching cartoons like always nothing's changed
jesus christ she's dead
stop it tweek we're pretending like nothing happened
phillip i think i may have accidentally killed celine dion
killing is never an accident you dickface
oh jeez change the channel
and in other news still no known cause of death found for elementary school teacher diane choksondik however doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach
they found the sea men it's only a matter of tiime before they find the women too
the autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined
oh god
we're dead
oh jesus  that's it man i want nothing more to do with you guys
tweek where are you going
they're gonna find you out then when they do i don't wanna be within fifty feet of you you're gonna fry man
hey tweek you're in this just as much as we are
what i told you not to put the sea people in her coffee i wasn't even there when you did it

we've only got one option you guys we're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves
gnaaahahahah  i pulled out my hair
wokay how about this dougie  ii'm going' to pose as a realestate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail and then skip town with all their money  no

episode f entitled so it's come to this
fine then maybe i'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus
simpsons did it
dwaah
there we just put the sea people back in the tank with the others and nobody will ever know  the blood is washed neatly from our hands
alright children i got you four tickets to thailand  and three hundred dollars cash  it's gonna be tough living for a while you might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before
it's alright chef we got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium
wait what sea people
the sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee
uhh maybe you'd better start from the beginning
and then we put them back in the tank
oohhh children you misunderstood sea people is different from semen
it is
yes that stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you it came from someone else  i thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher
well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach maybe they'll find our sea people too
relax children junk that's in brine can't kill you your teacher must have died from something else
oh really
egh i'm so relieved gaahahah
alright you children have had a long night why don't we all get some rest and on monday i'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people  come on children i'll walk you all home
okay goodnight cartman
g'night guys
i'm so glad we're not murderers
ah so great that everything is finally back to normal
h'you guys come quick  you won't believe it
oh no what now
those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and ah well look
whoa
wow how did that happen
i've been up for hours doing some calculations and i've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics  sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety
whoa
they've already accomplished so much
they're like bacteria small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate
that's right tweek and if my theory is correct all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents and we can really see them flourish tweek
hr
you go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad get at least five gallons of them here stat stan and kyle you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in
well what are you gonna do
me  i'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men
i've done it general disarray i've watches all one hundred and thirtytwo episodes of the simpsons twice and i've finally come up with something tha they have never done uh behold  this device that i have made will take the cherries out of chocolatecovered cherries and replace the inside instead with twomonthold mayonnaise  people will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet delicious cherry but instead they'll get a mouth full of yuckies and sticky mayonnaise hey  you've never seen this on the simpsons right
no i think the simpsons would be more clever than that
good then llet us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for shshunning us
tonight on the simpsons it's a laughorama when bart builds a machine that takes cherries out of chocolatecovered cherries and replace them instead with mayonnaise
nnno  uh no no it can't be

okay now let's put the sea ciety in its new home
nothin' to do now but wait
close your eyes and suck it out of a hose
uhhuh suck it out of a hose yeah

oh my god the tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years  look there's a library aand a temple and a who  oh they think i'm god  yes i am god of the sea people you hear that  i am god of the sea people i am master of their great sunken empire  mooom i'm god of the sea people
that's nice poopie
and in other south park news elementary school teacher ms choksondik's  autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor mr mackey  however the semen apparently did not contribute to the death and so mr mackey's identity is to remain anonymous
hey butters
haaa
hey what are you doing man cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody you've gotta come
cartman
ha ha
behold you all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness i am eric cartman god
hey we paid for the sea people too how come they're not making statues of us
be you not jealous jew i am creator of all things yea
that is very impressive eric what do you intend to do with your underwater society
i'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size so i can live amongst them forever
aha ahaha ahahahaha
what the hell is wrong with you butters
they did that on the simpsons ha treehouse of horror episode f the genesis tub lisa loses a tooth and the bacteria on it start to grow and makes a little society and they build a statue of her thinking she's god ha hahaha
so
yeah so
dude the simpsons have done everything already who cares
yeah and they've been on the air for like thirteen years of course they've done everything
every idea's been done butters even before the simpsons
yeah in fact that episode was a ripoff of a twilight zone episode
really so i shouldn't care if i come up with an idea and the simpsons already did it it uhdoesn't matter  everything is back to normal a i think i think i can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again
good for you
yeah that's great butters now get the hell out of my room
i feel like a spring chicken i'm ready to wreak havoc once again
hey look everybody the other side of the aquarium is building another statue
hey it's tweek
me aw man i don't wanna be a god that is waaay too much pressure
that is bullcrap you'd better stop worshiping him sea people
what's going on now
the sea people from cartman's side are suicidebombing the buildings on tweek's side
gaaahah
yeah go
now what's happening
the sea people on tweek's side just suicidebombed the cartman statue
oh goddamnit
oh no oh the humanity
well it was a nice project while it lasted boys
yep but i guess this proves that war is the natural order of life
why can't societies just live in peace
parents it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the young men's catholic retreat this year we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss jesus's role as the navigator of our lives
that sounds pretty fun
a catholic boat trip
the catholic boat's gonna be headin' on out todaythe catholic boat time to throw all of your cares awayget some hot christian action it'll make you
waaah waaah  uyah  ahem 'scuse me
look i just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a ccruise with the priests
we can let them go can we
there's no way my son's going
what are they talking about
i don't know
maybe they wanna kill us
with everything that's been in the news i think it's best to keep our kids far away from the priests
now come on everybody just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters
well sure that's easy for you to say your son's dead but those of us with alive children need to be sure that father maxi's on the upandup
i've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on
it couldn't hurt
uh shsh here he comes here he comes
uh goodbye everyone
goodbye father
alright then it's settled tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and find out the truth
hi boys my name is ms gorache and i need to ask you a few questions about your priest okaaay
okay
okay would you say that father maxi is nice or mean
nice
um cool
okaaay what words would you use to describe your priest
compassionate
okay and did father maxi at any time ever try to put something in your butt
ih in our butt
you don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed just did he ever try to put anything in your butt
like money what
you mean like a goldfish
no no did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt
no
this is ridiculous havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids
yeah what has catholicism come to anyway
you know i think we've just had it with the church all the horrible things they've done to kids i i think i'm gonna become an atheist
that's a good idea i'm gonna be an atheist too
let's all be atheists
yeah yeah alright
if there was a god why would he let our kids be molested in the first place
yeah let's kill god yeah
well uh let's let's just be atheists
same thing
yeah
what would the priest possibly want to put in our butts
maybe no
hey dudes
hey
arr
what are you guys doin'
we had to go meet with this counselor lady and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts
in your butts
yeah isn't that the damnedest thing
why would he put anything in your butts
we don't know we're that's what we're tryin' to figure out
hm
hm
hello there children
chef what would a priest want to stick up my butt
goodbah
rrrh nobody is going to tell us this is going to drive me insane
calm down tweek there has to be a rational explanation
aw dude i think i might have it
what
it makes perfect sense okay wwork with me on this if you eat food you crap out your butt right
yeah
alright now keep working with me here it's getting a little complicated if you eat food and crap out your butt then maybe if you stuck food in your butt you crap out your mouth  hm
cartman that's the dumbest thing you've ever said  this week
what that's not dumb think about it food goes in the mouth comes out the butt food goes in the butt comes out the mouth that's not dumb that's genius
it wouldn't work
have you ever tried it
i don't need to it wouldn't work
i bet you twenty bucks it'll work
you're on fat boy
okay let's go jew
yeah yeah down with god down with god
stan you're an atheist now
you too tweek
yeah yeah down with god down with god
i'm a what
fathers i want to thank you all for coming
no thank you for finally organizing an allpriests meeting father maxi i think we all agree something has to be done quickly
well i don't know how it's been for all of you but attendance at my church in fort rawlins is down sixtythree percent
i'm down almost seventy in greenleaf
uhyes uh i'm afraid if things keep going the way they are we could lose our entire religion
yes we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public
they've gotta know to keep their mouths shut
that right yeah
right and so wa wait a minute what
yes but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested stop the problem at its source
yes but how
something has to be done
we've got to stop this
whoa whoa hold on a second the problem is that children are being molested not that they're reporting it
how do you mean
well i mean obviously what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it i mean right
well did any of the children you've molested come forward
no
well that's good
no i mean i've never molested any of the children in my church
hihit's okay father maxi we're all priests here the doors are closed
oh for the love of god are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys we are here to bring the light of god not harm the innocent  i'm serious
father uh having sex with boys is part of the catholic priest's way of life
yeah
dear god this problem is much more severe than i could have possibly imagined i have to go to the vatican and get help
well cartman
hold on  god let a man crap
what's going on
cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth
oh
well go on smartass and do it
i'm doin' it already god give me a minute
you've had five dude
i can't i can't do it with you guys watching turn around
no because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth
ugh do you really think i'd be that deceitful you guys  ugh goddammit you guys this is so seriously
get the fuck out of here
yes yes i did it i crapped out my mouth  i crapped out my moouth  you owe me twenty bucks dickface
well there you go um grazie  wow i'm actually here vatican city
your holiness this is father maxi from america he has brought this all to our attention
your holiness
adoramus te christe
et dominus
cardinals bishops and priests an american priest by the name ofa maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news all over hisa country there are reports of children being molested by men of the church if things continue this way we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again
that's rightwait what
in france as well we are finding it harder and harder to make love to our boys
in morocco they have arrested five of my priests it's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us
father maxi what do you suggest we do to not get caught
not get caught no i i think what we should do is not have sex with boys
it is not written anywhere in the holy document of vatican law that sex witha boys is wrong
well maybe we need to change the holy document of vatican law
speaking on behalf of the british catholics it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the holy document of vatican law can not be changed
yeah it cannot be changed yeah
yes and speaking on behalf of the gelgamek catholics i believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem
gelgameks
kyle could you help me out i need some advice
what
it's just that i can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars  i was thinking of getting this megaman racer for  or i could get two broncos trading packs for ten apiece and then i thought
oh boy now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food
that's right everyone just dig in  so kidsanything happen with your whole sunday off
uh cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth
stanley
what he did
noho it doesn't work that way son
yeah it does
no it doesn't
yeah it does
honey honey come quick
look people i'm just trying to say that if we don't change the holy document of vatican law then we might lose everyone to atheism
what exactly do you suggest we change father maxi
well for one no sex with boys
the holy document of vatican law states that a priest bishop or cardinal cannot get married so where are we to get our sex
uh well then perhaps we could change the holy document of vatican law to say that it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex with women
women
the gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razorsharp teeth do you really expect us to have sex with them
wuh okay mmaybe we just need to forget about the gelgameks for a second and focus
what's that about the gelgameks
i'm just saying what works on planet gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here on earth you see that's the problem we're having here
buta the holy document of vatican law cannot be changed
why not
because we don't know where it is
you see father the holy document of vatican law has been hidden away deep in the catacombs ofa st peter's below us hidden away so that it can never be changed
but if we locate it we can make changes to it
ha good luck father the document is guarded by water lizards rattlesnakes and sand traps the fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths
well we have to try our religion is dying
you guys you guys look
harrr
i went down to the bank and got kyle's twentydollar bill turned into twenty singledollar bills
so
so so now i can do this  yeess yeess kyle's money mmmm kyle's money
go fuck yourself cartman
oh it feels so good on my skin mmmm
get up fat boy i'm gonna kick your ass
gee kyle don't be a sore loser it's over okay i won let it go
so you crapped out of your mouth good for you it's still stupid and immature
dude look
our top story tonight the ageold question has been answered if i put food up my ass will i crap out my mouth all over the country people are discovering that yes in fact you will  the surgeongeneral had this to say
and the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing but in fact much healthier for out bodies than the old way of eating  you see food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward and therefore i believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers and i base that on absolutely nothing
the surgeongeneral's response has made americans change their eating habits almost instantly
that's stupid and immature cartman
it is stupid and immature so you got people to crap out of their mouths what do you want a feakin' medal
the mayor of south park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating young citizen   eric cartman will be given a freaking medal
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
now with more on martha stewart's living
in the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential  now everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass  puddings soups raisins this is a nice raisin pudding right here  but we can also still eat our favorite foods what we're gonna do today is prepare a thanksgiving turkey for interorecto  now the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side
ms stewart we have some questions
not right now i just wanna focus on my turkey  right now  now we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice  this'll help smooth the insertion later on we still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound  when it's done we'll get something like this  so now we're ready to go looks delicious let's try it out  aaaaa yeah get it up there yeah aaaa yeeaahhhh  phew and that is how you eat a turkey  we'll be right back with more
beoo
ahh hello uh my name is father maxi from the united states
what do you seek father
i i'm trying to find the holy document of vatican law so that we can make revisions to it
that gospel  lies somewhere beyond this door  but many troubles await thee inside only he whose heart truly belongs to the lord shalla make it through
i have to try our religion is in trouble and and that scroll may be our only hope
then prepare yourself the time of trials begins  adoramus te christe  i wish you luck father use all the strength agility and faith that you have
very well here we go  hmmm there's a ladder up here  oh my god a rattlesnake  a way back up  i've made it praise be to god he hath shown me the way  this must be it the holy document of vatican law
well sharon and i are havin' a great time bein' atheist i for one can't believe i used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say
well it's true i mean what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world
atheism has definitely made our lives better
i made some quesadillas if anybody wants some
ooohh
and if anybody needs to potty there's a potty basket right here
oh thanks sharon
you know for martha and i we're we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist i mean  whoa thank you i mean  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a christian society  i feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs
that's true if i'm gonna raise my son to be atheist i don't want him saying under god every day at school that could really damage him under god should be taken out of the uh 'scuse me  moowwaaagh  under god should be taken out of the pledge of allegiance
that's right i agree  and it should be taken off of money as well  the religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel  bwwaaaagh  and we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids
that's right that's right
cardinals bishops and priests father maxi has returned and he has the holy document ofa vatican law
how did he make it past the water lizards
yes i have returned with the holy document of vatican law so can we please change  it now to say it's not okay to have sex with boys
wait waita the popea wantsa to say something  the popea says we shall ask the highest source
oh my
the holy one  behold the great queen spider
hail queen spider
queen spider
o great queen spider we seek ayour guidance
what do you ask of me
great queen spider we seek to change one of the vatican rules
the vatican rules cannot be changed so saith the spider
go on priest maxi see if you can convince her
alright that does it i've had enough you people have completely lost touch with the outside world you sit in this big room with your gelgameks and your queen spider and none of it applies to what being a catholic is all about
but the holy document of vatican law states that
to hell with the holy document of vatican law
you guys you guys  i took kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again and i got it changed into quarters
so
so now i can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long  yeessss kyle's monneey
cartman there's something i need to tell you
ohoo what's that kyle
you were totally one hundred percent right
heh  what
you won the bet you were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth and i've just been frustrated because i didn't think of it first i want you to enjoy that money because you really impressed me with your insight and i'm proud to have you as a friend
you sonofabitch kyle i hate you
yeah the pope is gone
great news stan the vatican is burning down
score one for us atheists
come on tweek we're gonna watch it on tv
gone it's all gone
well thanks a lot father maxi you've killed our religion
no i didn't all that's dead are your stupid laws and rules  you've forgotten what being a catholic is all about  this book you see these are just stories  stories that are meant to help people in the right direction love your neighbor be a good person  that's it and when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power well well you end up with this  people are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them they've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by well they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths
what was that last bit
look i i'm proud to be a catholic but i'm a catholic in the real world in today's world it's time for you all to do that too it is time for change
he's right sharon we don't have to believe every word of the bible they're just stories to help us to live by we shouldn't toss away the lessons of the bible just because some assholes in italy screwed it up
o randy i don't wanna put food up my butt anymore
gang i think maybe we owe god an apology
does this mean we have to go to church on sundays again
no it means we get to son it means we get to
oh cool a preview
coming this summer  it's the classic film that changed america et the extraterrestrial the new redone version for   all the et effects have been digitally upgraded  all the guns have been digitally changed to walkietalkies and the word terrorist has been changed to hippie
aw dude why would they do that
yeah hippies and terrorists are the same thing
no dude they only changed terrorist to hippie to make et more pc
that's gay
coming this summer it's the motion picture that changed america saving private ryan the rererelease where the word nazi has been changed to persons with political differences and all their guns have been replaced by walkietalkies
why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies
and now for your feature presentation the classic rerererelease of star wars the empire strikes back
woohoo
in the version the word wookie has been changed to hair challenged animal and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by ewoks
awwww
goddamnit that pissed me off
yeah we want our money back
sorry suckers
you asshole
why don't they leave those movies alone we liked them the way they were
don't you see what this means all our favorite movies are going to be changed and updated until we can't even recognize them anymore
tweek is right it isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different movies are art and art shouldn't be modified
yeah what if they had modified the roman coliseum every year it would just be another big douchey stadium now
we have to do something let's form a club
yeah we can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit
no fatass i mean a club to protect films from their directors so they can't be messed with
yeah we'll be the save films from their own directors club
yeah
no nono ah i don't wanna form a club that's too much pressure look ahi'm supposed to take it easy just watch the clouds sit on the grass and if we form a club there'll be responsibilites commitments
tweek now goddamnit we picked you to be our new friend to replace kenny because we thought you were a team player
i'm not i'm not a team player
now either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace you
d'ohho oh jesus

yeah
free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat
aaaah  okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding this is a rally to save films from their directors
to do what
we believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers
oh sorry um come on everyone guess we're in the wrong place
free hat free hat free hat
waitwaitwaitwait  don't you see what's happening out there the films you all grew up with that touched your lives and are part of your soul are now being updated and changed join us and we can be a group that makes a difference

oh yeeaahhh raaaaah woohoo
free hat free hat free hat
members
you guys you guys oh god um i've got terrible news
what
ted koppel wants us to appear on nightline to talk about our cause
really that's great
yah
no it isn't man thahat's waaay too much pressure
if we go on nightline the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films
but just remember that i do all the talking
you why
because i'm the official spokesman i got dibs on it
when did we do dibs for it
just now      dibs
me
gaahah
alright fine  you're the spokesman cartman but you'd better not screw it up
what could possibly go wrong
a new movement is sweeping the country led by four determined boys from south park colorado the organization was created to protect hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors and also to free hat mccollough so boys i ask you the question that's on everyone's minds why does your organization want to free hat mccollough the convicted confessed serial murderer of twentythree babies
i believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman tweek
gaaarh
well hat mccollough admitted he killed those toddlers why do you want him free
oh jesus man n'ahah
just answer me this tweek what do you see as positive about toddler murder
ahah uuh it's easy
yes it is easy  alright then on to your other cause saving films from their directors what got you boys interested in this especially given your protoddlermurder status
we believe that films have to be taken away from people like steven spielberg and george lucas because they're insane
well i'm glad you said that boys because joining us now are steven spielberg and george lucas
oh christ wwwaaaaaaah
hello ted
oh hi ted
gentlemen these toddlermurder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films your response
well first of all both george and i are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers
you're here
dude that's steven spielberg and george lucas
get me out of here please somebody get me out of heeerre
and as for altering our films all we're doing is trying to reach a new audience with our movies as the makers of dreams we like to speak for the children
ah i thought we were speaking for the children
yeah we're children
uhlook if the beatles went back and updated their white album every few years what would we have now
yeah these guys are only motivated by money ted
how so
think about it spielberg jew lucas jew kyle jew coincidence
i'm not a jew
you little brat ah i mean you darling children don't know what you're talking about changing et was the best thing i ewver did
dude don't you see that it's not it'd be like changing raiders of the lost ark
wait a minute what'd you say
eh that's brilliant
yes change raiders of the lost ark why didn't we think of it before
no noo
members this is our darkest hour we've just learned that george lucas and steven spielberg now intend to update and change raiders of the lost ark  there's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed mr secretary
thank you  our intelligence tells us that the original negative to raiders of the lost ark is currently somewhere in george lucas's house we need to find and usurp that negative
and if we get a hold ot the negative they can't change the movie
that is our understanding
sounds like a good idea to me i don't want them to change raiders of the lost ark
yeah
yeah we should go get that negative as soon as we get hat free
yeah  free hat free hat free hat
nonono we need to do this first
but we have to free hat
it's just that you know he killed twentythree babies
well yeah but it was in selfdefense
yeah
he killed twentythree babies in selfdefense
hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in west town park when that many babies get together they can be like piranha
three eyewitnesses testified that if hat hadn't killed those babies they'd have killed him
yeah  free hat free hat free hat
alright alright but right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of raider
he's right we'd better split up some of you go with the boys and get those film prints the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing hat
yeah  free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat
well it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves
no not this i'm out i can't deal with the stress you guys create
we're just gonna fly to california and break into george lucas's house what's stressful about that
hwaaah
okay tweek let me tell you something you've been our new friend now for two weeks okay and i've gotta be honest with you it isn't going well
haaah
people aren't that into you tweek they find you kind of annoying now i say you've got one last shot here and i don't want you to blow it okay does that help take the stress off
okay go
i'm breaking into george lucas's house i'm not breaking into george lucas's house i'm in a green field
stop tweek this is not the time for faggocity
this looks like the right room
i'm in a field surrounded by deer
over here
that's it
alriiight get it tweek
huh uh
get it you piece of crap before i grab your nutsack and twist it
guh huh huh
what are you doing
oh god oh jesus
you're the boys from that stupid club give me that
aaaaaah
do with us what you will mr lucas  but please don't change raiders of the lost ark
we're gonna make it better the movie's gonna be changed and that's that
alright you asked for it i'm afraid you leave us no choice it's time for plan b
aw really
oh god no not plan b
you have a heart made of ice mr lucas and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart with a cool island song gentlemen
what
hit it tweek  in the tropical isle with the coconut tree there's a lots of
waitwaitwaitwaitwait i thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song
no he has an icy heart
but you can't melt ice with a cool song 'tardheart
so we have to warm his icy heart with a hot island song
it's a cool island song
well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song
oh do we wanna do that
alright that does it
yes thank you officer  the police are on their way boys  soon you'll be in jail getting rammed
aaaahh
those rams can do to us what they will mr lucas but we'll never stop trying to protect films
it's not too late to do what's right give us the print there's still some good in you mr lucas we know there is
it is too late for me boys
you yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films you understand why films shouldn't be changed
mthat's different these are my movies i made them and i have the right to do whatever i want with them
you're wrong mr lucas they're not your movies they're ours all of ours we paid to go see them and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours
when an artist creates whatever they create belongs to society
have i become so old that i've forgetten what being an artist is about
give the print to us so that we can protect it from spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it
perhaps you are right
stop  what are you doing george
steven uh i
give me that print george we need to make the alterations
steven these boys had a point i don't remember what it was but it was good
you haven't let these doeeyed children affect your judgment have you george  don't forget you belong to me
don't listen to him you still have a chance to preserve your film
i'm ah i'm sorry boys
now take the children prisoner
what
you troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the new raiders of the lost ark your gay little club is over
fuck you steven spielberg come on you guys
oh my god they're gonna kill us
don't even think about it kid i'm not afraid to use this walkietalkie
the one with the cocaineproblem escaped mein direktor
leave him let him run back to his mommy  we must get the film ready for the premiere  lucas come
coming this summer  it's the digitallyenhanced rerelease of the very first pilot episode of south park  yes the classic rough handmade first episode is getting a makeover for   the simple funny aliens are now superbadass and kewl  flying saucer no longer cheap construction paper but a  megapixel constructed through a masterpiece of technology everything's new new is better
when we first made south park we didn't wanna use construction paper we just had to because it was cheap
and now with new technology we can finally remaster south park make it look sharp clean and focused
expensive
yes all the charm of a simple little cartoon  will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation
for instance in the scene at the bus stop we always meant to have imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background but simply couldn't afford it
get this special enhanced version quick because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for
members uuhh oh jesus uh we have to do something our club president  treasurer  and secretary  have all been taken hostage be steven spielberg haaa
prisoner you mean like hat
yes just like hat
but the governor won't pardon hat so how can we get him out of prison
no listen to me we're not talking about hat right now okay gad look we went to george lucas's house aand tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song but then spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner they're goin' to premiere their new raiders of the lost ark and we have to rescue them do you understand
hey he's got a point there
yeah maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song
yeah
no
no
no he's right we have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song
or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song
let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song
that's it
let's go come on
oh god i'm gonna have to do this myself oh god

oh sweetie you're all just growing up  part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next
but am i slutty just because i'm beginning to be friends with guys i mean they just like me because they think i'm smart and cool
i remember when i was a little girl the boys didn't think i was very smart at all but then one day they all started thinking i was really smart i guess big smarts just run in our family

right but first we gotta go to the
hoh
you guys calm down
timmih
this is insane
stop it you guys please
oh boy i never meant to cause all this trouble
hoh hoh hohhh hohhh
bebe those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out
i know they've been there all day
hoh hoh hoh hoh
hah hah hahah hah
hoh hoh hoh  hohohoh hoh
looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers
mom why is everyone acting so different around me
sweetie you're just blossoming into a woman
but i i don't know if i want to sometimes i think i'm not as smart and cool as they say that everyone just tells me i am because of my hooters
sweetie you're a stevens and stevens women are always told they're really really smart
mom  what's six times eight
oho sweetie those are two completely different numbers  alright boys time to be getting home bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today go one shoo
hoh hoh
aah we made it
boys can you call  for us
oh my god we've landed on earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over
i knew it you blew it up didn't you
i don't want to live in this futuristic madness
take your ape rule and go to hell
having boobs sucks
well hello there little girl my name is dr hallis what can i do for you today
i wanna have breastreduction surgery
you
yes i have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet
well young lady i'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age
why not britney spears got fake ones when she was a teenager why can't i have mine taken off
because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing making them smaller is insane
i think it's insane to want them bigger
why do you hate your breasts so
ever since i got these stupid things everyone treats me differently i feel like i might be treated differently the rest of my life
oh come on now that's just silly
here's the anderson file doctor
oh awesome thank you so much jillian that's great oh goddamn thanks you so much
and here's the coffee you wanted doctor
yeah whatever get out of here  now i was saying
please you have to help me i think that if my breasts keep growing this way boys will give me whatever i want
yeah so that's great isn't it
no it's not because if i grow up getting everything i want having things made easy for me because i have hot knockers then i'm gonna grow up to be a lame person if i'm handed everything in life then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero
that may be true but i'm afraid i just cannot ethically perform a breastreduction surgery on an eightyearold girl
damnit
if on the other hand you'd like to make them a little bigger i think now might be the right time to size up hm
oh fuck off
randy could you have a talk with stanley
why what's the matter with him
it's just that well he's been acting a little different lately
aaaata  aaaata
he's been ignoring his homework and all of his friends i can't figure out why
aaaata aaaata
ohhh boy looks like he's starting to notice breasts
oh yes our little stanley is starting to become a man
ahta ah ahta
hey there son
hoh ahta  ahta
yes ahta let's have a talk stan
ahah
stan as you get older boobs  buthese ahta will start becoming a major part of your life
ahta
but stanley you can't let them get in the way of your friends there are a lot of boobs out there son but they're just boobs your friends are forever
friend ahta
i know you think this set of boobs is important now but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs boobs will come and go and then someday  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry and those become the boobs that matter the most
i love you
if you can just understand that stanley you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all
the boys are at war all is going as planned
yes soon all the boys will be brought to their knees
we grow larger every day
and stronger
soon the entire tow
sh sh she's awake
ah quiet
mom mom
what is it bebe
my breasts
oh sweetheart you're just becoming a young lady
no they're conspiring mom they were talking they wanna destroy the town
yes darling your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older they feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can you're blossoming into a woman
that does it i'm not letting these things run my life
young lady are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts
yes i want to get breast implants
i tried to tell her she was too young
well it is a different time mrs testaburger society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best having small breasts can make her feel unimportant
but she's eight
yes well not too young to feel flat and therefore not pretty
that's what i said
however young lady i'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone  i'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go
i have three thousand dollars cash
you pass let's do this thing
oh wait you're gonna do it right now
suuure breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure  what we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water
i still don't know about this
look us plastic surgeons have one philosophy if we can help someone's selfesteem a little then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars
cha  gotta  jam it  up there  get  in  there  you  bitch  get  in  there  you  bitch  hah  okay there's one wendy doing great
m'kay kids we need to talk about your failing grades
bebe where bebe bebe bebe
m'kay we all need to start studying more and fighting less m'kay
bebe
ahta
hey guys
have you guys noticed that bebe isn't as cool as she used to be
yeah what the hell happened to us
oh my god i get it now it was bebe's boobs
bebe's boobs
oh cool it worked
don't you guys see boobs do something to our brains they fill our brains with illusions
sssssso bebe didn't become smart and cool it was just her boobs
yes
so bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was
right my boobs just clouded your judgment
but that sucks i don't want something to have that much power over me
i don't think it will you guys as long as we realize it we must learn to control their power over us
yeah screw boobs they're stupid
i'm sorry for fighting you guys
aw that's so sweet m'kay
let's never let boobs come between us again
hear hear
boobs are stupid
hi everybody

the ghost of human kindness
you have never seen the likes of me before
what do you want
you have lost faith in humanity lad something i cannot bear to see happen
huhuh how can i help it it seems that everywhere i turn someone is out to get me
that is the world of the news reports it is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with but it is not the world as it is
it isn't
look here tweek this woman is on her way to the retirement home  she doesn't get paid she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend  but do you hear about her on the news no
now gaze upon this humble house tweek inside there are two people who have adopted needy children  they were strangers to those kids once now they are loving parents
now look here boy  a car has broken down with a flat tire and two complete strangers have stopped to help  will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow i think not
are you starting to understand boy
i think so you mean that even though all the news is about murderers and abductors those kind of people only make up a very small part of the world
that's right lad so do you think you can learn to trust people now
i'll try
good then why don't you get into the back of my van and i'll drive you home

and this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before tom
turn it up
that's right chris this newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are not committed by strangers but by somebody the child knows in their own town  the report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place
well i guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard so to speak
sure does tom
alright thanks chris is the weather going to turn su
well if you'll all excuse us i think we'll be going now

and so all the residents of manhattan are prepared to evacuate if ms clinton's ass gets any bigger and in other news new findings on the increase in child abductions
oh jesus turn it up honey
the study shows that the most likely abductors of children are the parents themselves  the study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are committed by the child's mother or father the bottom line being that your children aren't safe even from you
where are you going
uh i'm just going to go upstairs and see if tweek is still in his bed
oh  i think i'll go with you
it's okay i can do it
i just want to make sure that you
that i don't abduct him how do i know that you haven't done it already
me i would never abduct our son
that's not what the new study says
well what are we supposed to do eh how can we protect tweek from ourselves
here you go stanley this should hold you over for three years
but why do i have to leave
the news says that at your age you aren't safe with us son you have to get out of here before we abduct you
goodbye son  remember to eat right
look out for your brother kyle you're the man now
oh boys don't ever forget that we love you

well our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend kenny again and and that he thought it would work  if he built the ladder to heaven
they just believe in their little hearts that it will work we can't tell them it won't we just can't
it shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is
a ladder to heaven that's fuckin' stupid
these boys symbolize how we all feel about loss who are we to tell them it's impossible
tom people from all over the  sorry  people from all over the country are coming to see the ladder feeling a connection to its symbolism and beauty even country singer alan jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder  alan jackson is of course the man who wrote the song where were you when the world stopped turning about the tragedies on september  and now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions let's listen in
where were you when they built the ladder to heaven did it make you feel like cryin' or did you think it was kind of gay
what a beautiful song
well i for one believe in the ladder to heavenoh yeah yeah yeah i said    nihi hihineeleventhank you i have a new cd out with all my  songs for sale right here

the nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend  it's making americans start to believe in heaven again
well when i see how this ladder has brought people together how how it has changed america i mean how can i not believe
ha do you actually believe in the ladder to heaven
if heaven is an eightyearold boy and the ladder is my penis  and the pearly gates are the
uh meanwhile the american economy cont  wait wait wait a minute we are getting reports now that japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the us's let's go live to snn correspondent nobuhiro sabasurisurijuwa
this is a nobunaga hiroichi reporting rive from tokyo where japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben  ahready the japanese radder extend faaar into space  and it's growing by aone thousand miles every day  as the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that japan will reach ahayben before the united states
nahurabo nahurabo
excuse me  excuse me  uh we ran out of stuff  we ran out of stuff to build the ladder with
oh no
oh jesus no
where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven
we can keep going but we need to start tearing down houses for wood
no agh look i i think maybe this has gone on far enough
yeah ih it's time we told the boys the truth that they aren't really going to get to heaven
wait look
we've come to help you beat those japs boys  there won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today  alpha team get that support structure up ciranom's team get us photos and recon
yes sir
where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven
man i can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back
candyshopping sprees have that effect on people kyle
do you see anything
no hello kenny god
grandma
aw don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet
no cloud city not even a giant heaven must still be a long way off
alright look i didn't wanna have to say this but i think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough
huh
heaven could be like the pixie faeries of bubble yum forest you only see them if you really believe in them
what
you know maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a joo
what does me being a jew have to do with anything
because jews don't believe in heaven
yes we do just not the christian heaven
right your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at barney's beanery by lying about a hair in it
haahh
ah
hey kenny
hey kenny
we can watch it at my house
in the ghetto in the ghetto he's a boy wearing orange who's losing his pride 'cause kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto in the ghetto
shut up cartman you bloodbelching vagina
what did you say
i said shut up cartman you bloodbelching vagina
what did you say
i said shut up cartman you bloodbelching vagina  did i just call myself a bloodbelching vagina
dude what the hell is wrong with you
i dunno i just i keep feeling like i'm kenny seeing memories through his eyes
you're too fat to be kenny
you're a stupid jew
let's just keep building we only have five more days until the shopping spree
alright how's the ladder going general are we beating the japanese
not quite but we have a new problem mr president our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats from saddam hussein
saddam hussein but we killed him we secretly took him out months ago
yes sir and now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction in heaven
dear christ that sonofabitch just doesn't stop
these surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven  here we see what we believe to be a missile silo and here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons
that kinda looks like a seagull
yes it could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull
that tricky bastard
sir you must understand our fears we must take out those facilities we must  bomb heaven
snn question of the day now that americans believe in heaven should we bomb it the polls right now show that  of americans think saddam has to be dealt with while  are wimpy treehugging pussies
war is not my voice this country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns
we have to take saddam out to protect ourselves
i for one believe that if saddam hussein were an eightyearold boy and my penis were the united states  then there would  hard nipples
goddamnit
tom it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts they've made a nation believe heaven might be up there and it could prove to be a threat to our country president bush will seek un approval for military action
boys it's really neat that you want to see your old pal kenny so much but
but it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives
no we have to see kenny
you have to understand that kenny's body isn't up in the clouds he was cremated
cremated what's that
when you die your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes
what for god's sake why
kyle it's just what some people do
are you gonna burn me
kyle that's not the issue right now
jesus christ
the person's ashes are put into an urn and that's where kenny's body is
you see boys kenny is in here  what the  wait a minute this is kitty litter
alright alright i drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter
you what
dude don't you know what this means you drank kenny
shut up
you did dude you drank his whole body
shut up
oh my god this is awful  and disgusting
bad eric bad
that explains it why i'm having kenny's memories all the time his soul is inside me
well so much for our winning ticket cartman probably drank that with the rest of kenny
yeah good job fatass
i can't live like this i i have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body
looks like i've come to the right place
can i help you
yes hello i have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out please
you'll have to make an appointment the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars
two hundred and thirty dollars i just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium
it's gonna be okay babe
listen lady you've got to get this crap out of me  i don't want him in me anymore just suck him up and throw him out
oh steven i can't go through with this i have to keep it
damnit damnit  thanks a lot kid
eh
kenny kenny kenny
kenny lolly's candy land is giving away a shopping spree
we're all gonna pitch in on an entry
alright there you go hold on to that ticket stub
hold on to this cartman i might lose it
nah i'll lose it for sure you keep track of it kyle of it kyle of it kyle
okay nno ah i don't want that much responsibilitybility here you hold on to it kenny
okay
you'd better not lose that ticket kenny or else i'll kick you in the nuts the nuts the nuts
the ticket kenny didn't have it on him when he died he put it away somewhere  don't you see i can still have my candy shopping spree oh my god  you guys you guys
ladies and gentlemen of the un we have evidence that saddam hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction  we have tried to communicate with saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven but he has not responded
of course he has not responded because he's dead
right dead and in heaven
this is preposterous even if there was a heaven what makes you think saddam hussein's soul would be sent there
our intelligence tells us that when saddam was originally killed his soul actually went to hell but while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with satan the prince of darkness satan however decided he didn't want to be with hussein anymore and broke up with him about august  when saddam became jealous and tried to kill satan's new lover chris satan had saddam sent to heaven to live with mormons as a punishment  question  yes
are you high or just incredibly stupid
i assure you i am not high
you guys you guys i saw the ticket
what do you mean fatass
i just had another vision you buttholes kenny didn't keep the ticket with him he put it away somewhere
where
i don't know i got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and i clearly saw kenny putting the ticket in a little red box  i just have to wait for another vision to come i could clearly see through ken  ay
do you see anything
yes kyle i see a dead jew
whoawhoawhoa maybe kyle's right we gotta spark the vision somehow
not by giving me brain damage
do you want a candy shopping spree or not
alright go ahead  ay no  ay
randy gerald we we were wrong about heaven the japanese just reached it with their ladder
what
see for yourself
this is a nobunaga hiroichi reporting rive from hayben  the great anation of japan reached ahayben today about eight o'crock pacific standard timeeh  therefore hayben is now adecrared an official part of japan because we got ahere first and now for the weather in heaben let's go to natsako semu
todeh weather in hebon partry croudy
that's the news from heben  dame dame da bakayarou da
oh god and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven
kids
good as soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take saddam out
do you really think this is a good idea randy
if saddam is building weapons we have to stop him with our weapons
ah excuse me everyone uh we're not working on the ladder anymore thank you we're done
dude
not working on the ladder but the japanese won't let us use theirs
kenny didn't have the ticket stub it was in his room so we got all our candy and you can all go home
wait are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy
i've never heard the words only and candy in the same sentence before
but what about your lost friend what about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven
yeah well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels
yeah but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to maybe heaven is just an idea a frame of mind or or something gay like that maybe heaven is this moment right now
so you're saying we should bomb this moment right now right johnson
sir
no no we shouldn't bomb anybody these boys are right the only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth now we should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to create it
awwww
and i was dumb enough to believe saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs
where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't you couldn't really get there  you little bastards ruined my latest song
well i'm sure glad this is all over with let's go count our candy
yeah but what about kenny his soul is still in cartman's body
no no i just drank his memories i'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap stop calling me poor you fat dick  oh jesus christ
whoa  kenny you in there
stop it where am i you guys oh god
dude come back here
stop him kenny
keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads right chopchop come on
saddam i've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here
weapons of mass destruction nooo this is a chocolate chip factory see
it looks like a chemical weapons plant
look god if i was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant i wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant would i i'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something
alright just checking
stupid asshole
o great wizard of gregendath what quest do you ask of this ranger and paladin

and so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to stan'ses house
this copy of lord of the rings made the young butters behave quite awfully

perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen
well well well if it isn't robin hood and his merry men
oh crap the sixth graders

there's four of us kenny's soul is still trapped in cartman's body
yeah
oh man i can't wait to see this
dude that video is making people act strange
the one tape must be returned  run

oh hello randy sharon
uh chris are the boys over here
no just butters he's been watching the lord of the rings downstairs
oh dear

we  well this is really sort of funny but uh we we accidently put aporno in the lord of the rings box
ohh godd
butters
butters  butters
the precious  could you bring back my precious
butters where is the movie you were watching
they took his precious took it away to watch without him  he was really enjoying that movie too my precious
the boys must've come and saw what it was and then taken it away somewhere
oh no
we can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape
i must say i agree if this copy of the lord of the rings is tainted it would not be safe in the wrong hands
i smell fourth graders
oh crap dude
hide
hey  i think i see something down the hill
ogh
phew the one videotape is sought after indeed
yeah butters my parents now the sixth graders
come guys we must bring this all to the attention of the high elf of paragon
yeah the high elf he'll know what to do
and so that's the situation all the boys are out there somewhere with a pornographic videotape
oh god this this is horrible
all right calm down now just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here i mean was it like crotch capers
i'm afraid it was backdoor sluts
backdoor sluts
is that bad
backdoor sluts  makes crotch capers  look like naughty nurses
iit is the single most vile twisted dark piece of porn ever made
how the hell do you know
i uh iii read about it in people
oh this is just great how could you two be so careless
we're sorry
well sheila we can't shelter our boys forever from these things maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film
not without their parents to put it in a proper context they won't understand what they're seeing
itit can't hurt 'em that much can it
precious  let me see my precious  pleeeeeeease
open  bellog
what do you guys want
we must speak with the high elf of paragon
oh okay hang on a second  what troubles you
we have in our possession something of great power  it is the lord of the rings
so i have three copies and the dvd with twelve hours of extra footage
yes but this is not a  wow twelve hours yes but this is not a normal copy it's making people act really strange
we're seriously high elf something very evil lurks in this tape
very well i shall call the council together meet me in the woods of gathering behind talangar the black's house and don't let my mom see you 'cause i'll get in trouble
thank you high elf of paragon
faragon asshole
clyde's a dick
alright everybody listen up there's three snotnosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called backdoor sluts
ooooooh
i checked it out on the internet and it said that backdoor sluts  is the most hardcore porno ever made
ahhhhh
i have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary now let's go get that porno
and so that is the situation the video may or may not have evil power kyle would you bring it up here please
ahhh
that video could have been made by sauron's evil fforces
it could hold a mental spell of some kind
perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers
kevin goddamnit
look until we see this tape's power for ourselves we cannot risk giving it to anybody
but if we watch it we could fall under its spell too
that is true only a paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape therefore i think it is a job for you talangar the black
i am not scared i'll go inside and watch the tape  just for a few seconds if i do not return in two minutes send a party in after me  the fate of middleearth is in my hands
fourth graders give us that porno
boys
boys we're not mad at you we just wanna talk to you
talangar the black returns from watching the video
what vice did you see on the videotape talangar is it the work of sauron's magic
i'm not playing anymore
uh wellwait what'd you see
i don't know i don't wanna know i'm out
my god this thing must really be powerful
this tape makes people freak out wherever it goes
what do we do with it
one thing for sure this tape cannot be trusted with anybody this must be returned to the video store from whence it came
well where is the videotape rented from
two towers video store iin conifer
conifer walking there would take hours
there's no alternative we have to return the tape before it causes more damage
i'll go
ha we cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf especially a kindergartner dwarf
you're too young
quiet
you guys this is stupid
you're acting like a bunch of assholes
i will take it  i will walk to the video store
it is too far and too dangerous to go alone take with you the wizard  the dwarf  the warrior  the cleric  and the jew
paladin
very well you shall be the fellowship of the lord of the rings good luck i have to go home now before i get in trouble
me too
yeah yeah yeah
only the six of us are to go
no no there's seven of us kenny's soul is still trapped in cartman's body remember
yeah stupid  yeah luckily cartman's body is big enough for the both of us  shut up kenny
so it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return the lord of the rings to the video store
we have reached the great pass of mount ururalak
look out
we were almost killed
a dark wizard must be trying to stop us
true someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store
oh hello everybody
steve uh we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago
well yes i believe they were but they've gone what's the matter
we think our boys might be showing other chiildren a uh pornographic tape
what but token's never seen a porno before he wouldn't know what tooh god
token
token did the boys come over and show you a movie
token  alright token we know you must be very confused about what you saw
yes uh you see token that was called a pornographic film iit shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse  well yyou see when a when a man and a woman fall in love the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina it's called lovemaking and it's part of being in love
and when the woman has four penises in her at the same time then stands over the men and pees on them is that part of being in love too  five midgets spanking a man covered in thousand island dressing is that making love
jesus what kind of porno is that
it was backdoor sluts
oh jesus not that one
oh gerald poor kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid
uh token this is very important do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape
we're entering the limits of bailey everyone stay close

boys boys
crap parents  come on guys  we'll see you next time fourthies
and perhaps they would but for now the sixth grader army was defeated
there you are
oh kyle you're safe
oh hey guys uh we were just about to come home we had to return the video
aalright now now listen kids there's some things we need to put into context for you you see a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure but sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths  uh this is called ing and it's normal
see boys a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it feels good to have a man's penis inside of it
that's right but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things telephones staplers magazines it's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive it's like a fun tickle
now on to double penetration boys you see sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man each man makes love to a different orifice
that's right it's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting
it's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other
going number  or number  on your lover is something people might do but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it
okay boys do you have any questions
wow
well let's all get going
yeah come on boys time to get home
wait a minute where's butters
wuuwees hases our preciouseses hases it hases it
you wanted to see me principal victoria
yes mr garrison have a seat  mr garrison sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade
i'm aware of that
i wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences it was wrong of us and i want to make it up to you
wow that's really great to hear
as you know the position of fourth grade teacher has become available and we'd like to offer you the job
oh for real you're not kidding
we in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences and we respect that
oh this is all just this is a dream come true  thank you principal victoria i'll do a great job
i know you will
you're sure this is for real i mean i'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow
it's for real mr garrison
ohho great
with all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now you'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars
right uh  wha what was that
well i was just saying that the policies have really changed you know we fire you for acting gay next time you'd be able to sue the school district for lots of money
oh right right right i huh how much money exactly
oh well there was the case out in minnesota where the guy was awarded  million i think
yehyou don't say  well thanks uh principal victoria  holy moly i've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay
m'kay kids i know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher ms choksondik
funny
but the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place so i want you all to give your best behavior to your new fourth grade teacher mr garrison
awwww
not him
thank you mr mackey
good luck m'kay
okay children now for those of you who are new my name is  mr garrison
where is mr hat sir
well i was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for mr hat
twoyearolds are too old for mr hat
but it's okay because i found a new teacher's assistant say hello to  mr slave
hi kids hm
so that's  mr slave  the teacher's assistant  or as i like to write for short the teacher's ass
oh jesus christ
okay mr slave go sit until i need you
ugh
dude i think that mr slave guy might by a  pakistani
i'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy in fact it's going to be long and hard  really long and really hard
oh jesus christ
eheh the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist russia
no kenny what are you doing kenny
now stalin was a big silly when it came to
kenny no don't do it kenny
eric did you just throw a paper airplane
no it was kenny
very funny eric kenny's dead
yeah but cartman drank kenny's remains and now kenny's soul is trapped in cartman's body
yeah
that does it i will not put up with foolishness in my class it's time for punishment  take it mr slave
ohoh oh it hurts
i will  not put up with  tom foolery in my  class room children  mr slave put this rubber ball in your mouth  take that slavey take it  this'll get me fired for sure
i really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book
yes and i really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate america
well i think in the fourth chapter when uh nancy drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage
so full of metaphor
hey guys can we talk to you
oh hi boys
how was school
uhh not cool
that's great we're having our book of the month club meeting so why don't you boys go outside and play
was it me or did you all think that nancy drew solved the riddle of elephant mountain a little too easily
no no he said not cool we got our new teacher today it's it's mr garrison our old third grade teacher
uh huh
well he has this new teacher's assistant and uh and they're both totally gay
kyle you know better than to discriminate against homosexuals
yeah but these guys are really supergay
aw i'm surprised at you stanley i really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were
yeah but dad
no buts stanley we're not raising our kids to be discriminators
that's right i think it's time you kids took a little trip to the museum of tolerance
welcome to the museum of tolerance here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in america
ey
now did you know that words we use can show intolerance  let's begin our tour with a walk through our tunnel of prejudice to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against
queer beaner chink nigger heeb faggot cracker slope
aw man this is awesome
now you know how it feels
i wanna ride again i wanna ride again
we are now entering the hall of stereotypes these wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities  here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon a stereotype that hurts the africanamerican community what other stereotypes do you see here
ah here's the arab as a terrorist
that's right but of course we know that not all arabs are terrorists don't we kids
wwwell there's an asian over there with a calculator
that's right not all stereotypes are negative but even a positive one like all asians are good at math is harmful to society
look a covetous jew
very good young man the idea that jews are only interested in money is very old indeed
ah here's a good one  it's the stereotypical sleepy mexican
waiwhat oh man what time is it
oh i'm sorry i thought you were a wax sculpture
naw man i'm the janitor i'm s'pose to be cleaning but i'm so tired ongh so sleepy
this is our discovery wing take your time at the computer displays  because you see being tolerant you must also respect people who are small people who are disabled even people who are overweight  like this young man here
ey
you other boys have probably called this young man names like tubby or lardbutt or fat tits
fat tits that's a good one
yeah i have to remember that
but you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well if he chooses to eat fatty foods that's his life choice
i'm not fat i have a different life choice
and we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies
duhuhude tolerance kicks ass
that's our cartman
well that's the end of our tour
now do you see why tolerance is so important boys
i guess
we have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do  hey what the hell are you doing
oh i was just uh
there's no smoking in the museum
but i'm not in the museum
get out of here you filthy smoker
yeah dirty lungs
go ahead and kill yourself stupid tarbreath
dumbass
get out of here
well have a great day everybody
now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve right
yeah
okay children let's take our seats uh apparently none of you tried to get me fired yesterday so i guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today  now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the bunsen burner
it evaporates
good butters now if we take the glass tube of the bunsen burner we can also see how other things react  evaporation is an exothermic reaction so let's look at an endothermic one mr slave position  please  now i'm gonna put the glass tube under mr slave's tight ass  the heat from mr slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy
aah
okay now butters could you bring over lemmiwinks for me please
sure
oh no no no no no no
newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction  thank you butters now what do you think is gonna happen when i introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of mr slave's ass  well let's see
aah  aah  dude jesus christ aah
lemmiwinks no
hello there children
hey chef
how's it goin'
bad
why bad
chef we're intolerant
intolerant of who
gays i guess
now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people children  i thought you knew better
well we didn't think we were but mr garrison has this new assistant and we're really uncomfortable around him
children a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves you have to ask yourself what is it about their behavior that for some reason makes me uncomfortable
well i guess it's mostly the way mr garrison stuck a gerbil up mr slave's ass
right and you see children that's why you need to whoa what
are we homophobes now
we don't wanna be gay bashers chef
children there's a big difference between gay people and mr garrison do you understand that
nno
you children just take your lunches i'm gonna have a talk with the principal
i'll take three lunches today please
you don't need three lunches eric you're fat enough as it is
it is my life choice chef and if you don't tolerate it i'll report you to the sec
that was a brilliant idea having me put a gerbil up your ass mr slave  now we'll get fired for sure
well it wasn't the first small animal i put up my ass
mr garrison to the principal's office please
that's it they're gonna fire me for being gay twentyfive million here we cooome
don't forget i get half oooooh  oooooh jesus christ
lemmiwinks you must find a way out of this place or you will surely die  this way has been closed off by the great sphincter to escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach  who am i just a friend heed my words lemmiwinks your time is running out make for the large intestine all will be made clear then

oh no you're firing me oh well i can't stop being who i am i can't help the way god made me guess i just have to go
no no no we're not firing you
you're not
no we're sending chef to a tolerance seminar
sending chef to a tolerance seminar you've got to be fuckin' crazy
you demonstrate a lack of tolerance for mr garrison's behavior in fact i believe you used the words sick queer to describe his conduct in class
he is a sick queer
yeah
i just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to mr garrison before i send you away chef
kiss my black ass
parents i had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers m'kay
we're not staying in class another minute with those queermos
well i really thought you boys really learned something in the museum of tolerance but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers
but they killed lemmiwinks
shut your mouth butters you'll speak when spoken to
yes sir
mr mackey we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children we don't know where else to turn
well there is an intensive seminar camp it's a bit severe but it might be the only way m'kay
that sounds good to me
mee too
then it's settled boys you're going to tolerance camp
tolerance camp
welcome to tolerance camp you are here because you would not accept people's differences  because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man well those days are now over here you vill verk every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody here intolerance will not be tolerated
goddamnit
how'd it go
this is unbelievable mr slave it seems no matter what i do i can't get fired
the principal didn't fire you
no the parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the courageous teacher award this friday at the museum of tolerance
oh jesus christ
i mean i stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a goddamn medal
well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody what you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are
oh well  hey that's right mr slave  the parents have to see for themselves  the awards ceremony well we'll put on a show they'll never forget

oh that's courageous
look this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher
yeah jesus christ
but the museum tells us to be tolerant
yes the museum
the museum tells us
tolerant but not stupid look just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it if you had to like it it'd be called the museum of acceptance  tolerate means you're just putting up with it you tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or or you tolerate a bad cold it can still piss you off jesus tapdancing christ
he's right our boys didn't hate homosexuals they just hated the way this asshole was acting
we'ge gotta get our boys back
ogh okay so now can i please get fired and get my  million dollars

we're sorry boys why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so overthetop
yes you boys don't know how much we suffered
come on let's go
but this is insane
i'm sorry mr garrison but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior
vhat do we have here noo recruits i assure you the next veek will be nothing but pain and suffering

oh for the love of christ  i wanna watch fat boy  no kenny it's not funny
kyle kyle
don't try and stop me stan this is what my grandma wants
look i went and saw that john edward guy he's just a big douche
he's not a douche he talked to my grandma
kyle you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said they all just use a technique called cold reading they've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them
hey whoa now john edward is for real
no he's not
yeah my sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died
john edward oh yeah i heard he walked up to a guy on the street and said his dead father wanted to say happy birthday and it was his birthday
yeah kid how do you explain that
alright look i'll show you i just need a volunteer how about you
ohho me
okay i'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you okay
okay
okay watch kyle uh it's an older man someone very close to you
my father
does this month november hold a special significance
my birthday's in november
right because he's saying tell her 'happy birthday'
oh my god
see kyle i just started with something really vague i chose an older man because i'm betting that based on this woman's age her father is most likely dead but if her father wasn't dead i could still say it was some other older man
well then how'd you know her birthday was in november
i didn't i just asked her if november meant anything her father could have died in november or thanksgiving could have been really special for them but i go with the birthday and validate it now as if i knew by saying he wishes you a happy birthday
what else does he say
okay i'll just use an old standard he saying the money stop worrying about the money
oh my god my sister and i have been fighting over his inheritance
that's amazing
no it isn't when a father dies inheritance is usually an issue and money is something everyone worries about
that sounds a little too coincidental
yes there's only one explanation this kid can communicate with the dead
wow
what
do me next i wanna talk to my mother
can you try to reach my grandfather
no wait
you have to tell me if my sister's in a good place
yeah help me out too 'k

at a vary young age one young boy learned he had a special gift this is the other side
okay listen to me listen very carefully  this is a trick that i am doing okay watch all i'm gonna do is say a name that i'm gonna pick at random okay  they want me to acknowledge pete or peter
yes yes my peter
wow
no stop clapping all i did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response now that i see that there's a lone woman crying my instinct tells me peter was her husband so i say peter was your husband
yes yes yes my husband peter
wow
oh wow
stop it i didn't do anything
you knew peter was dead
i didn't start by saying peter is dead i started by saying they want me to acknowledge peter that could have meant peter was in the audience or that peter was somebody's friend or peter had died i couldn't be wrong see now i can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died so i can say something like i'm getting that peter's death was very untimely
yes it was
wow
amazing
ask peter if he knows my little billy
okay let's back up  not literally
in the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free

here look kyle i found tons of testimonials on the internet saying that john edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show and he pays actors to be plants in the audience
you're just jealous he's a better psychic than you
fine i give up you wanna stay in new york then go ahead
so you think you can talk to dead people better than me huh
no i don't think either of us can
they told me your show is getting better ratings than mine that you're saying i'm a fraud on your show you'd better not ever call me a liar or a fake or a douche again or else i'll sue you for slander
i'm saying this to you john edward you are a liar you are a fake and you are the biggest douche ever
everything i tell people is positive and gives them hope how does that make me a douche
because the big questions in life are tough why are we here where are we from where are we going but if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions you aren't just lying you're slowing down the progress of all mankind you douche
i'm not a douche and i challenge you to a psychic showdown i'll prove to the world that i'm psychic and you're not
fine douche

here it is  it has to be something eh wait what's this  this expires in two thousand two why does he have this in his wallet
i don't follow
three four five one colfax avenue come on butters
oh are we out for an adventure
here it is motivation corp
i don't think we're supposed to go in there stan maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else
butters part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go
oh well you're good at adventurin' huh stan
what the hell is going on here
it should take about a month to achieve the results you want  well mr and mrs brooks i think you're going to be very pleased with the results
we sure hope so we just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs
well now you won't have to ah here he is this is josh casher he'll be playing the role of your future son
nice to meet you mom and dad
my goodness he does look a little like kevin
yes and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house and he's worked up quite a future for your son
i'm going to tell him that i dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years where i was sodomized in the ass
woohoo that should get kevin to stay clear of drugs
heh it sure should heh
alright then we'll put the fake news report out on tuesday night make sure your son is watching the channel  news
oh and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well
motivation corp takes care of everything  just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives
listen to me you crazy person there's no way you can be from the future oh this is going to be fun
i can't believe it it's all a scam
yeah i can't believe it
they've all been lying to us this whole time
this whole time i wonder if my future self knows anything about this  hey maybe my future self remembers this happening aand can shed some light on this subject
butters don't you get it those assholes aren't our future selves our parents hired them to make us more motivated
eh but then why did they come back to the past
they didn't come back to the past you dumbass they're actors
oh oohhhh  but that's like they're lyin'
it is lying butters your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me get it
ohhh that makes me angry why if professor chaos were here he'd make everyone pay
who's that
you know professor chaos bringer of destruction and disorder
what
follow me back home stan it's time i let you in on a horrible ssecret
wait right here stan i warn you you may not like what you're about to see
we have to teach our parents a lesson show them they can't just play with our emotions like that
now you know my terrible secret
you're gay  it's fine if you're gay butters i don't care
huh naw i'm professor chaos stan
but we have to teach our parents a lesson butters we're running away help me find the perfect place to run away to
mm uhm maybe i used a little too much silver
how about this winter farm it looks kinda nice
no we gotta run away somewhere warm
wow look at this stan  are you sick of your parents do you want revenge for something they've done to you call the parental revenge center of western america for a free consultation results guaranteed
dude i didn't know there was such a thing
hey look somebody lost their pet
uh hi is this the parental revenge center of western america  ah i'm really pissed off at my parents and i wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them
look you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks
oh really oh okay uh where are you located please  great uumm can i come by tomorrow
this lady'll massage your wiener for ninetyfive dollars well that's a pretty good deal
eleven o'clock is great thank you  that was easy i just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents
hahhey i wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents too
fine then you can come with me
hooray  and then we can make our wieners bigger and have the lady massage them
i guess this is it
uh hello we're here about the revenge on our parents
yes come in please
cartman
oh stan butters i didn't know it was you guys
what the hell are you doing here
i'm running a business stan are you my eleven o'clock
you're the parental revenge center of western america
goddamnit i knew this was too good to be true come on butters let's go
eh so you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you then  look ah i don't know what your parents did to you but if you're here i take it they pissed you off pretty good maybe you should at least hear what i have to offer
oh sorry i thought this was a legitimate business
that it is i assure you i started this business over three months ago from the ground up i've been helping children get back at their parents ever since
how many parents have you exacted revenge upon
craig's aand clyde's oh and and kyle's but that was a freebie look i run a legitimate business here with stateoftheart computers charts and technology look around you i know how it feels to be really really pissed off at your parents and i will work hard for you
our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves it was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol
goddamnit see this is exactly why i started this business if a parent can't respect their child than who can they respect huh
yeah
listen parents understand one thing and that's consequences they need to see consequences from their actions or else they'll never learn what my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way
how much is this going to cost us
eighteen thousand dollars  how about just three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine ninety five  how about five bucks
so everything is working out with your future actor your son seems to be responding
i think he's pretty scared alright
it's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this
well you know what us ultraliberals say when it comes to children and drugs lies are ok the ends justify the means we'll take smoking for instance the truth is there's no hard evidence that secondhand smoke can kill but we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking
well that makes sense
so it is with everything here at motivation corp it's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism  or that one pill of ecstasy is gonna kill them it's not necessarily true but the ends justify the means
well i think when this is all over our son is gonna thank us
okay butters let's start with you i think i've found a great way to get revenge on your parents just tell me if i'm going in the right direction here  what we're going to do butters is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house and then smear all the walls with poop
hwuhh that'll make them awful sore
now i want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches
poop poop swatches
poop comes in a lot of varieties butters i wanna find the perfect one tailored to your revenge on your parents
hey that's neato huh stan
now personally i like the baby green  but i also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house
wow eh eh you sure are a pprofessional eric i don't know which swatch i like best
well yyou know what we could do uh uh butters is go with the baby green in the living room and then maybe a classic brown or even a nutncorn crunch in your parents' bedroom
well that sounds good
okay well let's do that then that looks nice
hooray
alright now stan for you i've put together a really nice design i feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that so what i wanna to is put a note on your parents' door telling them i'm the counselor from the school
yeah
the note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me rightaway back at my office
yeah
your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place
yeah
and while they're gone we're gonna smear all their walls with poop
wow neato
that's not neato that sucks
what
you're gonna smear butters' parent's walls with poop i thought his revenge was unique and customized
poopsmearing is the hot ticket right now stan and have you seen the poop swatches
dude that's not extreme enough my parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls i want them to see what they did was wrong i want them to have them to admit that they lied to me
okay okay fine i i just i just my first idea that's why we have these consultations  okay okay lemme lemme see here uh oh wait oh this is nice how about this uh we'll lure your parents out of the house and then we'll kill them uh we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
dude
extreme enough for you how's wednesday
no that's too extreme
well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme where do you want it
just forget it cartman you don't know what you're doing
i'm a professional suh  don't worry about it butters you're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied
hey future self
yes former self
you know that thing that i kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that i've never told anybody about  you know the thing that i take out of the shoebox every night before i go to sleep
oh uh
you must know what i'm talking about
sure uh uh  oh man could you all excuse me for a second i think i'm gonna crap my pants
uh stan  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little
yeah stan don't be so hard on yourself
mom dad i don't think that guy is from the future
oh you you don't
no  you know what i think i think this is all an elaborate hoax  and i think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me  see the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them to be honest with them i think the whole future self thing is a lie and lies are never the right way to get your message across
well you know what i think stan
what
i think he is from the future
yeah he must be  it's like i just feel he's our son you know
right that's mother's intuition you can't argue with that no stan i think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol
right
okay very nice very nice oh wait uh goddamnit felipe  the classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom the living room is supposed to be all baby green poop
qu la caca no esta aqu
la caca de moreno no es aqu aqu es verde seor es verde arriba arriba
s s seor
s gracias y t  carlos carlos no we want a textured effect on the nutncorn crunch poop that's why we  spackle with the sponge  see spackle gently lo marrado gently see marrado
s marrado
marrado spectacularrr
s
god it's so hard to find good help  ah butters like what you're seeing so far
boy it sure is stinky in here
yeah well three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden butters but i think it's coming together real nice
look eh eric i've been thinkin' my parents are gonna be awful sore and i don't think
yes well i've done my job haven't i  pepite pepite no no come la taco la trabajar
yes well it's hard to find work in commercials so i ended up
oh stan
oh dude how's it goin' man ey you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek
hide and go seek huh
yeah stan why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself
i don't believe that he's my future self
yeah but we can't be sure so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette huh
no i actually have a way to be sure  i'm going to cut off my hand if he is my future self then his hand will disappear
sstanley you don't need to do that hehe is your future self
but i have to know for sure
don't be silly stan you don't wanna go through life without one of your hands
maybe it's the hand i smoked that first joint with here i go i'm gonna do it
stan
yes
uh nothing go ahead
randy
aaah
aaahhh oh my god look  what his hand did disappear he is you from the future
oh jesus christ help me
that's weird because i really didn't cut off my hand it was fake
uh  look it was fake in the future too
looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana huh stan
well butters i hope you like the work i'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off
uh and after my parents get angry uh how do we get the poop off the walls
ooo ah that's a different company  oh someone's here we'd better run out the back pepite carlos vamonos
uh but cartman wait  oh christmas
butters
oh stan
butters we've go oh god it smells in here
yeah well three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden
butters we're running away
we are
our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong and they're never gonna change
what the hell is this
oh my god our house
oh geez ah i'm gonna get it now
butters do you have an explanation for this
oh not really sir i just uh
wait a minute chris don't you see this might be our fault
what uh my god you're right linda this is what we get for deceiving our son
huh
butters listen the whole future self thing well it was a dirty fib
we just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of telling you the truth
we thought the ends justified the means but they don't they just don't son
we're sorry baby
get the fuck out of here
stan stan oh okay uh you you might be wondering why butters has a future self too
yes well eh you see son the time matrix pulled in more people from the future
aw stop it you guys i know all about motivation corp all i've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me
oh well son we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are
i've been told a lot of things about pot but i've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true so i don't know what to believe
well stan the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism but well son pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything
i really really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning
he's right if we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them
well there's only one person i can blame motivation corp
oh god who smeared crap all over our walls oh jesus it smells oh
you really did a nice job eric
yeah i gotta admit you really came through thank you i thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby
well here eric i baked you a huge box of cookies as a present
thanks but you know all this talk about future selves has made me think maybe i should take better care of myself i mean maybe i should think about who i'm going to become
atta boy eric you've made the right choice
who the hell are you
haha it's me cartman you from the future  i came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around you stop eating junk food and you start studying harder you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become ceo of your own timetravel company
oh wow really that's so awesome now i'll really work to be successful
right on
go have sex with yourself asshole i'm not that stupid just for that i'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what i want and doin' drugs when i want  whatevuh i'll do what i want
no wait  oh goddamnit
avaaalright i'm done
you're done
yeyes ii've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice
yeah so how's it look
it doesn't look good eric it doesn't look good
but i'll still be getting presents this year right
aaaactually it looks like you're gonna owe santa three hundred and six presents
what
four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice is is bad
three you didn't deduct all my nice invoices look look what about this one
yes waai didn't think hitting clyde in the balls with slingshot really counted as nice
it was nice for token he laughed for like  minutes
ye you can't deduct things like that eric santa will know and then he'll come after you
goddamnit i have to get that haibo robot doll you sonofabitch
hey hey  i'm just your naughtyandnice accountant don't blame me for the numbers
haven't you seen the haibo doll it's like a pet a robot pet you have to feed it and pet it or else it dies and it's the coolest thing ever santa has to bring me one
but what look aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here
uh oh i brushed my teeth last night
eh brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice eric it just it falls more into the category of brushing your teeth
well there's still time before christmas can't i still make up for it
if you cure cancer and aids next week you would still owe two presents
jesus christ
ah i'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do the nicest greaatest thing anyone has ever done ever

well i dreamt that i was lying in my bed  in the dark when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room  then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing i remember i was being drug through a hallway  then these scary hands wanted to operate on me  and they had big heads and big black eyes
dude visitors
totally
what
that wasn't a dream cartman those were visitors
no it was just a dream  my mom said so
visitors are real they  wait a minute this has all happened before
yeah this does seem really familiar
what the funk  wagnalls are you talkin' about
cartman don't you remember the last time you had this dream
ehih shut up you guys you're just tryin' to scare me
no dude this happened before aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship you don't remember that
no i don't remember that
you don't
no because the aliens erased my memory
i remember this whole thing  ike tried to follow you to school you kicked him then cartman told us about his alien dream
yeah and then chef pulled up in his car
hello there children
and then you said
what's gonna be for lunch today chef
well today it's salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley
weird
say did any of you children
see the alien space ship last night
what the
chef we're in a repeat
a repeat
cartman was visited by aliens again last night and now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day
aw dude i hate repeats
i've been feelin' dj vu all mornin' children i knew somethin' strange was goin' on
it all started when cartman got an anal probe
we have to get eric to a proctologist right away
what is a proctologist chef
he's a doctor that specializes in your asshole children
you mean at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes
that's right
what a dick
hello everyone
hello doctor thanks for seein' eric on such short notice
what seems to be the problem
we just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal
other than his monstrous size
shut up kyle shut your goddamned mouth
all right let's see here  oh my god
what
why there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle
haha very funny
yeah like we haven't heard that one a zillion times
all right let's take a look
heey just what the hell do you think you're doing
eric the doctor has to feel inside your rectum
and afterwards he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it
kyle i swear if i didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now i'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts eh oohh eow
well the prostate seems to be normal no swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland
eh aaaaah oooooah uuuuu aaaaa
wait what's this
are you okay
dude you know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump awesome
well doctor
i've never quite seen this before uh perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream
aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh
you all right
you know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass no im not all right
i've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way
that wasn't no hemorrhoid it was an alien hoobajoob come on children we've got to get eric to some real help
where to now chef
that thing inside eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish we need to see my friend down at the space center now
and you're the only person i could think of who might be able to help us jeff
how do we uh make it come out
someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did
ohhh no no nonono nobody is putting their finger in my ass again unless it's kyle

all right then we can get back to business follow me this way earthlings  i want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky scary stuff we just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay
you mean the thing in cartman's ass
that's right see there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums your friend's has been malfunctioning
why do you put them into people's asses are you planning some kind of alien takeover
oh heavens no we're a production company we make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches
television
we at nerzod productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy the best universal television isn't scripted it's real  we started with great shows like who wants to marry a gelgamek and antares  millionaire and then we had a big hit with get me outta here i'm a klingnanian but then of course there's our signature show the greatest universal reality show of all time
earth
a few billion years ago we realized what if we took species from all different planets in the universe and put them together on the same planet great tv right asians bears ducks jews deer and hispanics all trying to live side by side on one planet it's great
our planet is just a realitytv show
well you don't think the whole universe works the way earth does do you no one species one planet there's a planet of deer a planet of asians and so on we put them all together on earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun
you mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other dude that's messed up
why
why because you're playing with people's lives you're turning people's problems into entertainment
yeah we'd never do that on earth
ladies and gentleman we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe  when decoded it looks like this
what does it mean
ih it's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system translated into our language it looks like this
this jannemon at eight o'clock it's everyone's favorite show earth it's been one hundred gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together on the same planet ooderp they've fought and fallen in love what will happen this galgamog tune in jannemon at eight to find out it's earth on fognl
i'm afraid that earth aall of earth is nothing but an intergalactic realitytv show
my god we're famous
waaaait you don't understand
i'm on tv i'm on tv
this is so awesome
woo yeah woohoo
that should get the relay working again  all right earthlings if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to earth  oh excuse me  this is nagix uh huh oh no oh no really and it's it's for sure all right i'll break the news to everyone no no i i understand thanks  well you kids can go back to earth if you want but i'm afraid it won't be there for long the show's been cancelled

the universal network heads they say the earthlings have become aware of the show so it won't be funny anymore
oh shit did we do that
everyone can i have your attention real quick uuh look i just got a call from the network and i'm afraid earth has been cancelled
awww

i am better with each passing day  stronger and more agile
christopher i've come to ask you to stop what you're doing
what
using stem cells is like playing god you should leave nature alone
and go back to the way i was is that what you're saying hackman
i'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt christopher
stop calling me christopher that name no longer has meaning to me christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair always being pushed around by others the old christopher reeve is dead from now on i am  chris
sixtyfive bottles of beer on the wall six
payback time mothafucka
jesus christ  holy gguacamole  freakin' frijoles  leapin' llangosta
east side bloods
we're detectives hyde and richardson from the special gang unit in denver

the bbloods
you know smartmouth your rival gang the bloods are at war with the crips they kill each other all the time
thethey do
don't act like you don't know you lil punk the crips and bloods hate each other and if you stay in that gang you're gonna end up dead too
but but why do they hate each other
look kid i used to be a crip myself but i'm not anymore
oh so you used ssstemm cells like christopher reeve
come on the only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed
sarah
oh boy timmy we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident boy were we wrong
timmih
wow wwe've got to do something timmy we've gotta get the crips and bloods to sstop fighting i bet if we could just get them together but how wuwait a minute i've got it a lockin at the rec center we did it for our church once all we do is rent out the rec center overnight they lock the doors so nobody can leave and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk

tom several years ago actor christopher reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed the irony of course is that the man who played superman could no longer walk america watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers then his arms and now seen for the first time on hbc christopher reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head
oh what a fighter
that brave brave man
he's an imspration to us all
tom the irony is even more ironyy as it appears that the stem cells have given christopher reeve almost superhuman strength
chris that's enough
hello gene so good to see you
you're cured chris it's time to stop using stem cells
stemcell research has made me stronger than i ever thought possible why stop now
uh tom apparently gene hackman the man who played superman's enemy lex luthor in the movies has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stemcell research if that isn't ironic tom i don't knw what is
they're affecting your mind chris if you won't stop using stem cells then we'll stop you
stop me stop me ha  you won't stop me hack man  ha ha ha ha ha haa haa  ya ha ha yaa haha
tom if irony were made of strawberries we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now
come on in everybody lots of susurprises and ttreats inside  great to see you all what a terrific audience

it's called a lockin at the rec center we can use all the rec center facilities we can play basketball go swimming or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ppuzzles
timmih
but nobody can leave until it's seven am so if you wanna have a good time you're all just gonna have to learn to get along  theeerrre's pizzaaa
tom over five years ago doctors told christopher reeve that he would never walk again but the resilient actor fought back struggled against all odds and has now built his very own legion of doom  the once immobile mr reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil what an inspirational story tom
i have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery  their desire for world conquest  and their hatred of all things good  and i've assembled this group for one purpose to once and for all find a way to  get rid of hack man
uhhh how about domination of the world
yeah or uh death to the infidels
silence our job is to see to it that hack man is put out of commission
oh boy general disarray muh maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one

okay last night all four of us were at the bowling alley until about  at which time we noticed ally sheedy the goth chick from the breakfast club was bowling in the lane next to us and we asked her for her autograph but she didn't have a pen so we followed her out to her car but on the way we were accosted by five scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests which were administered at the scientology center in denver until  at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in rancho de burritos rojos south of castle rock and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger named gary bushwell arriving home at
i'm confused did ally sheedy take that personality test
yes dude
kyle it's very simple we followed ally sheedy out to her car but on the way we were accosted by five scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests which were administered at the scientology center in denver until  at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in rancho de burritos rojos south of castle rock and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger named gary bushwell arriving home at  you got it
ah ah i ah i thought
oh for christ's sake
look kyle just let cartman do all the talking okay he's better at being in trouble than anybody
thank you stan  sh sh here they come here they come  and so i said 'that's a terrific joke wendy tell us another one' oh hello mr mackey are you ready to see us now
we're gonna talk to you one at a time boys m'kay kenny will you step into my office please

kyle so help me god if you jew us out on this one i will fucking kill you
there we go that should be about the last of it  ex excuse me uh whawhat are you doing
crime scene investigation  there are several footprints in the snow perhaps more than one perpetrator
ah look we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this
is that the toilet paper there i'll need to take those bags as evidence
loih ih it's just not that big a deal i mean i toiletpapered houses myself when i was a kid
you so where were you last night at around
i was here
aha got you
officer why would i tp my own house
insurance
it wasn't me okay now if you don't mind i just wanna get my yard back to normal
now you listen to me whoever tp'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets it's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized i have to stop that from happening
you really have nothing better to do do you
no i do not
noo no  noo
aaaaaaaaa
oh jesus no our house
mommy mommy
whyyy whyyy whyyy
oh god oh god i have to tell the truth  mooooomm
hello kyle going somewhere
i was i was just going to get a drink of water
no need i have one for you right here
oh okay thanks
is there anything else i can get for you
noo i'll just be going back to bed now
you do that goodnight kyle
josh meyers tp'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year  he's a real monster
i just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think
just remember he'd toiletpaper you in a second if he had the chance  he's the last cell on your left
hello josh my name is officer barbrady i'm with the south park police
that's a terrible cologne you're wearing officer you should try something more casual
i was hoping you could help me solve a toiletpapering case
and why would i do that because i'm such a charming fella
uh please i need your help what would you want in return
due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell you can imagine how bothersome that becomes
you know i can't give you toilet paper josh
no but it was worth a try wasn't it  tell me something officer why is it that you police such a small town you must have had larger inspirations what happened to those bigcity dreams
well that's kind of personal
quid pro quo officer tell me what i want to know and i'll help you catch whoever toiletpapered that house
look kid i have very little time to catch whoever toiletpapered that house tell me what you know
are those the crime scene photos let me see them  yes yes not bad work not bad at all these toiletpaperers are professionalsat least one of them is
so you think there was more than one why
tell me something first when you went to the academy you had something to prove you wanted to protect and serve but mostly you wanted to protect yourself who were you protecting yourself from officer barbrady
oh all right all right my uncle charles used to hit me with a belt
thank you your toiletpaperers are most like males between the ages of  and  and probably virgins parents notice that much toilet paper missing so they would have to have bought it themselves find out where the toilet paper came from officer and you just might catch your man
stan kenny can i talk to you guys for a second  i think we have the counselor and the principal fooled but we need to talk about kyle
what about him
come on you know he's losing it he's gonna crack
i think so too
kyle can't take the heat he's gonna sing like a canary then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did
haey fellas
butters
look you guys all it takes is for one of us to crack and we all know who the weakest link is
so what should we do
we have no choice we have to kill kyle
dude we're not killing kyle
yeah
why not
kyle's not gonna say anything alright
he almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office he can't even keep the story straight i'm telling you guys he's weak he's weak and he'll be the end of all of us
you wanted to see me officer barbrady
yes thanks for coming mr bell a house was tp'ed in south park and i need to see if you can identify the toilet paper i recovered from the scene  i'm sorry i have to do this
oh my god
is this toilet paper from your store
it's difficult to tell it's so decayed i wait a minute yes yes i recognize the floral pattern now
positive id on the toilet paper
who would do this to toilet paper who
mr bell do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days
suspicious like how
well like someone who was black or mexican or middle eastern
nnoo the only mexican guy i recall bought toasted tarts and chips and we don't allow middle eastern people in the store  oh my god
what's this all about cartman
i just wanted to see how you're doing kyle why don't we go out for a little boat ride
a boat ride
i just thought we should find a private place to talk
well okay
could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat  okay let's go  so how are things kyle
terrible every time i close my eyes i see the house we tp'ed i see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters
and you feel like you have to confess
i don't know what to do  part of me feels like i wanna end it all now  tell people what heppened you know i never knew how beautiful this pond was before  so cold the world can feel like that  so calm on the outside as if nothing bad ever happens  ow  what the hell are you doing cartman
i'm killing you but unfortunately i could only afford a wiffle ball bat so it's gonna take a while
cartman
don't fight it kyle it will only take longer just slip into sweet unconsciousness
you wanna kill me fine  i can't live like this anymore go ahead do it
won't be long kyle
josh i need your help
the answer is right in front of you but you can't see it
how do you mean
tell me the toilet paper was it quilted
yes
singlesheet
no twoply  what what does that tell you
why does one toiletpaper houses
to get revenge
no that is incidental your toiletpaperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house thus transforming her entire occupation
what do you mean

alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps
whoa uh oh thank you your toiletpaperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class students who aren't very good at art

officer barbrady butters didn't tp that house
why do you say that
because it was
wiffle ball anyone  anyone care for a nice game of wiffle ball
you know it's not my parents i'm worried about it's my girlfriend carrie why she lives in michigan but when she finds out about this woooo smokey is she gonna be sore she might even break up with me and it would serve me right too

what hu how can you feel bad somebody else is gonna pay for our crime
yeah that makes it even worse
bu eh kyle you don't seem to understand we're we're not gonna get punished for this ever
i know
so so then how can you feel bad
he feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it
but he's not gonna get in trouble
it doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not you can still feel bad  i think you're right kyle maybe we should confess
yeah maybe we should
what eh  hey you guys there's nothing to feel bad about we're we're off scotfree
we feel bad for other people
for other  uh oww ih ih ih is it that you think you might get in trouble later
tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us and let her decide what to do  and cartman if you had any thread of a conscience at all you'll do the same

i know you're in a very dark place now sweetie but you must come toward the light come toward the light
here we are then the current residence of master thomas jefferson
super neato
i'm afraid you'll have to wait here
but i need to talk to the founding fathers to do my report
sorry only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to mister jefferson
oh okayi guess i understand 'i don't wanna wait for our life to be over''i don't wanna wait for our life to be over
hello i am thomas jefferson
and i am the official messenger boy i am
very well take this document to the continental congress
wow the declaration of independence day
some favir going to war with england and others want to avoid war at all cost
it's a bitch ain't it
perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all good luck young messenger  now make haste
okay so thomas jefferson wrote the declaration of independence then the continental congress
no war no war no war
oh jesus
uh boys would you mind clearing the living room we have to practice our big war protest song
dad we have to study mr garrison is making us do a presentation on what the founding fathers would say about the war
hey that's a terrific idea
yeah we could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on saturday
oh no nononono
support our troops support our troops support our troops
see i told you they had your son
kenny what are you doing over here with all these unamerican traitors
i'm doing my homework
the boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the founding fathers would agree with our right to protest
actually we hadn't really come to a decision
look my son is a patriot and loves his country  come on kenny
but dad i
now
yeah
support our troops support our troops support our troops support our troops
kenny no ohhh awww  awww now we lost two in our study group
god damnit
can you believe those hick sons of bitches manipulating those kids to be on their side
disgraceful stan and kyle it's up to you to show all those warmongerers that the founding fathers agree with us
yeah that's right
come on guys
get back to work
do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap
enter young messenger  i am john hancock president of the congress
wow
mr john adams
aye
will you do the honors of reading the document to congress please
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one penis to rise up  we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honorps  every thursday should be free ice cream day
excuse me but does this declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with england
we have no choice mr dickinson
all right everyone thank you all for comin' out to protest the war m'kay
don't kid yourselves these people have come out to support our troops right
and now randy marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war
oh no you don't we're doing our prowar song first
yeah the last thing these people want is a bleedin'heart rock protest song
people i told you you have to share the stage
nobody wants to here another prowar country song
well excuse me if i'm a little bit country
well i'm a little bit rocknrollah
i'm a little for supportin' our troops
and i'm a little for bringin' 'em home
i believe freedom isn't free
no but war shouldn't be our goal
we must defend our country
if it means war then we say no
yeehaw
'did you forget them towers in new york'did you forget how it made you feel'to see them towers come down'were you like me did you think it weren't real
i like to rock but i don't wanna rock iraq the only kind of rockin' america should do is the kind that we can all dance to yeah
we got gps icbms and good oldfashioned lead we're gonna show saddam what america means that son of a bitch'll be dead
why are we fightin' this war'there's a man in the office we didn't vote for'they didn't give me a choice'war is not my voice yeaaaaahhhh
we must go to war
but what about the violence the lives lost if we found a country it should be founded on peace and diplomacy
england will only understand one thing force
i must state again for the record that south carolina north carolina pennsylvania maryland and georgia are against war
yeah because you don't care about the fate of the colonies like we do you're all unpatriotic and if you don't like the colonies then you can git out
don't you call us unpatriotic we're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our colonies you are all unpatriotic for leading the colonies into a war that half of them don't want
whoa how very very relevant
tom i'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eightyseven hours the crowd still appears to be split right down the middle  half of them support country music and the other half rocknroll let's listen in
and now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special south park students who did a report on what the founding fathers would have to say about the war
booooo
for you people who still think war is the answer perhaps you can listen to the voices  of the children
uh we didn't do it
what
we didn't do our homework
boys you were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the founding fathers
well first we lost one study partner when cartman put himself in the hospital and then they took kenny away and then kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for dalight saving so we couldn't find anything in the history books about iraq and then
that's because the founding fathers would have supported the war
the founding fathers would have protested like us
support
protest
country
rocknroll
rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble
we cannot found a country based on war
we cannot found a country that is afraid to fight
rabble
rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble  oh my it's benjamin franklin it's benjamin franklin it's benjamin franklin
oh it's benjamin franklin it's benjamin franklin it's benjamin franklin
mr franklin where do you stand on the war issue
i believe that if we are to form a new country we cannot be a country that appears warhungry and violent to the rest of the world however we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world so what if we form a country that appears to want both
yes yes of course we go to war and protest going to war at the same time
right if the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish then some will support the war and some will protest it
and that means that as a nation we could go to war with whomever we wished but at the same time act like we didn't want to if we allow the people to protest what the government does then the country will be forever blameless
it's like having your cake and eating it too
think of it an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another
and we will call that country the united states of america
wow i get it now i get it  whoa here it goes i wish i could go back to my time to my time to to my time
wow
everyone stop please
thethe child the child from the hospital
if you all don't mind i would like to do my report now i know what the founding fathers would say
he does
he does
i learned somethin' today this country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen and they knew one thing that a truly great country can go to war and at the same time act like it doesn't want to  you people who are for the war you need the protesters because they make the country look like it's made of sane caring individuals and you people who are antiwar you need these flagwavers because if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters we'd get taken down in a second that's why the founding fathers decided we should have both it's called having your cake and eating it too
he's right the strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another
yeah but if it weren't for all you guys protesting why everyone around the world would hate the american people instead of just the president
and if it weren't for you people flexing your arms america could easily get taken over by terrorists or or china
i guess we owe you an apology
ehah i guess we owe you one
awww
cartman cartman saved the day
can't be
the founding fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want as long as we agree that america kicks ass
hey i'm a little bit country
and i'm a little bit rocknrollah
i'll be the muscle of america
and me i'll be the caring soul
and when you put us together you get a nation with one goal to thrive and prosper with a little country and rock and roll
come on up here everybody
we're a little bit country and we're a little bit rocknroll
we can be a nation that believe in war
and still tells the world that we don't
let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole cuz we're a little bit country and we're a little bit rocknroll
well goodnight everybody it sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes
we want to thank our guests the prowar people  and the antiwar people
what the hell are they doing now
ii don't know
for the war against the war who cares one hundred episodes
i hate this town ii really really do
and in conclusion the latino community has provided america and indeed the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without and that is my presentation on the role of hispanics in american technology thank you

yeah me too
yes  oh hello boys
hello sir south park junior detectives we're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved for a dollar
oooo little crime stoppers huh well i'm afraid i don't have any crimes i need solved right now
awww shit
all right sir well please call us if you need anything
i'll do that have fun boys
stupid assholes  how come nobody has a crime to solve
yeah maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea
it's a great idea we just have to keep working at it
oh hello there boys
hello ma'am we're detectives with the south park crime unit do you have any crimes you need to be solved for a dollar
ohh neighborhood detectives huh well let me thioh yes there is something
really
yes two days ago i put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool  and later when i went to get it it was gone
my god
have you reported this to any other authorities
noo but i think it's a perfect case for you kids
cool we'll see what we can find ma'am
we're on the case
what have you got marsh
detective mccormick found something interesting
jesus we're too late
i think we can piece this case together now
my pie tin oooh but what happened to the pie
well we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory
well what do you think happened little detectives
you said you set the pie in the window sill where it must have sat for some time  but its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody
your husband  he wanted that pie badly but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet
slowly the rage built inside his mind  why won't she let me eat that pie why does she always stop me from doing what i wanna do his only solution became obvious kill her
his plan was to use a hammer
bash bash bash your skull in causing instant death
then to make it impossible for police to identify the body he'd use a shovel to remove your head
then saw off the arms and legs
the torso he would dump into the lake
the arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub
and then finally he'd be able to eat that pie
but before he could go through with this entire plan he discovered that the pie had already been eaten  by your dog
looks like the game is over old man
oh my god what kind of television have you kids been watching
just the news
all right all right you you boys run along now
hey you owe us a dollar lady
fine here just go
wow look you guys our first dollar
we're in business
kenny you got the fag on that perp in washington
boys you have a little visitor
is this the south park crime unit
ah oh
yes it is
i lost my dolly
thank you ms secretary that will be all  and get some more cookies and coffee we're not paying you to sit on your ass
do you kow where your doll is
if i knew where it was it wouldn't be lost
all right sarah come over here  now i want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist kenny
she has curly blonde hair and a red dress and a turnedup nose and a blue bow in her hair
you got it ken
all right let's see  dammit kenny that's not what she said
put that away dude
don't worry ma'am we'll find your doll
no sign of forced entry
but the window isn't locked
right so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree  he would have watched sarah with the doll possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife  the pain gave him sick pleasure
disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy he would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it
we're going to need semen samples from everything in this room
all right let's do this by the books mcdonnell  give me smears of all the places the doll used to be  mitchell  run a tap on the phone
hey kid what are you doing
agent tucker fbi and you
detective marsh i'm in charge of this investigation

uh wu we weren't sleeping mr garrison
oh well then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties
a bunch of fat old skanks on their periods
right but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period  that's what i thought now pay attention  okay children now the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of
marsh broflovski mccormick cartman in my office
eeagh
looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg they found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in colorado
un oh
the operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in inglewood they're all cop killers so i'm sending you in undercover
uh sir d'i have a lot of homework to do tonight and i was
what now you listen to me i'm givin' you one last chance you're good cops but you let your emotions get in the way and your little shoot first ask questions later technique has no place in this century now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books you got it the mayor is on my ass and blablablah
so what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant

oh you heard him sheila kyle wants to leave our nice old house doesn't interest kyle anymore well i'm calling the moving company right now
well you shouldn't be such a dick dude
what's wrong with gerald
he he lost his house to the native americans
what but don't the native americans know he has nowhere else to go
they don't care
look at them smallminded idiots pouring their lifesavings away
their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo
yes but we have milked this simple mountain folk almost dry if we really want to see cash flow we need to bring in city people from denver
yeessss it is time for us to implement our plan  a superhighway built from denver right to our casino
and what do we do about the small town of south park that lies in the highway's way
simple we buy it and we demolish it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
and that's really all i can tell you the town of south park is going to be leveled in order to make way for a twelvelane superhighway
but how can they do that
the native americans have purchased the land from under us tomorrow they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership
well can't we stop them let's call the bank
the native americans bought the bank
oh my god
now look it isn't all horrible the native americans are offering you retail values on your homes
no screw that we'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves
yeah let the south park people own south park
how much do we have to raise mayor
three hundred thousand dollars
ohhh never mind
how can they do that huh how can they make us all move away
because they're rich greedyass indians
native americans
our whole town gone we'd had such great times here
we can't let them do it you guys we have to find a way to stop those native americans
yeah
yeah this is our town
we shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else we're a team
yeah
that's right
yeah ahh that's right
yeah we're a team
we just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars
wait a minute i've got it you guys we can get kyle infected with aids and then start a charity organization that we steal money from come on let's go  no we can't give kyle aids
we need something that'll get us money tomorrow
hey i know how about a dog parade
dog parade
yeah we dress up all our dogs in little outfits and parade them down the street  it'll be so adorable
how do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that
oh uh well we could sell tickets to our moms and dads
our moms and dads are the ones who need money butters
oh
maybe give kyle aids huh lookin' a little better now
oh gerald i i can't watch
how can you do this to people
we're sorry but if we do not build a superhighway our casino might stop seeing profits
there's more to life than profits
well like what
well like you know slurpees and stuff
well come on honey i guess we should start packing up our things as well
yeah  so long south park
mom dad we figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars
a dog parade
no
stan we've all tried to raise money but we only raise ten thousand dollars and the deadline is tomorrow
i know so how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the indian casino tell them kyle
the odds on a single number in roulette are thirtyfive to one  that means with a ten thousand dollar bet you win three hundred and fifty thousand
boys that's ridiculous
look we we've got nothing to lose
what do you guys think
it's a long shot
yeah  but it's the only shot we've got to save our town
the residents of south park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars but in the end managed to raise only ten the loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of south park  awww i think i'm going to cuwhy
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
all right boys you're gonna have to wait here
dad  good luck
it's in god's hand now  stand aside everyone
what are they doing
we're gonna try and beat you at your own game chief runs with premise ten thousand dollars  on thirty one black
impossible
come on come on
thirty one black
yeah all right woohoo oh we did it we did it oh my god oh this is amazing
no nooo
south park is saved
we have plenty enough to save our town now
yeah but wait  three hundred and fifty thousand dollars that means if we won again it will be twelve and a quarter million
we can save the town and be superrich
oh hell yeah let it ride
let it ride
woohoo yeah
what the hell are they doing
let's go thirty one let's see it
two red you lose
awwwwwww
dammit
hmmm

all right stan okay
you people just got greedy like the native americans
hey mister we're not like them all right  now we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes so don't you compare us to those coldhearted moneygrubbing evil stinky indians  i'm sorry native americans

yeah they don't own our town we do
i'm sorry boys you just don't understand economics
it'll be okay boys we'll just move to the next town over
oh sure until the native americans decide they want that land too what if the native americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh until we have nowhere else to go we have to stand up to them now  rrrgh forget it come on you guys
you're all a bunch of goddamned pussies
get out of our way
no we won't let you destroy our town
boys it isn't your town anymore
just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours we grew up here our parents grew up here we shop at that walmart and eat at that chili's we take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks this is not just a town it is our way of life
well your way of life is about to change little boys now move
you can't just roll into places and take people's lives away
and what are four little boys going to do to stop us huh
we are strongno one can tell us we're wrongsearching our hearts for so lohhooohhooongboth of us knowinglove is a battlefield
this land is not for sale
dammit i thought you said they were dealt with
they were
sorry charlies you can just keep your filthy bastard indian money
filthy bastard native american money
uh oh right huh sorry about that
this isn't over
we'll never give up you bastards
yeah south park is ours
but what do we do now i mean we can't just stand here and block their way forever
we can stand here as long as it takes
what is the state of our people
last night i spoke with the spirit of the bear and bear said that if we do not build our highway soon our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino
yes and eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day
then we must force the south park people off their petty land
but they are determined and proud and the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force it could be a publicity nightmare further hurting our net assets
i already have a plan how we can force them off our land sneakily  we're going to give them  blankets
blankets
yes we will present the blankets as a peace offering but what the roundeyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with sars  they will all get sars and then sars will run through their town like a buffalo now i need your help getting the sars onto the blankets  okay bring them in  let's see how south park deals with this  everyone grab a chinese person and rub them on a blanket  make sure you rub them all over get the sars nice and deep in there
tom i'm standing in chilly south park colorado where the residents are entering the third day of their sitin to try and stop native americans from building a superhighway through their town the temperature is low but spirits are pretty low too
what do they want
we're not moving assfaces
free blanket  though i know we have differences we believe a compromise can be reached in the meantime it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold will you not take this offering as a gesture of goodwill
you had me at free blanket
free blanket free blanket free blanket
tom it now looks as if the native americans are handing out blankets as a sign of goodwill towards the south park people what an incredible display of compassion i certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it
please as a token of good faith
you understand if i'm a little wary of trusting you
it is only a blanket mister marsh
well thanks
oh you're welcome
tom it's tuesday morning now and the outbreak of sars in south park has reached epic proportions  the entire town has been quarantined by the federal government nobody allowed in our out which means nobody can come to our aid  it appears this town and this reporter are done for coming up next choosing the right hair conditioner what you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle
it's all right dad
how's your mother
she's hanging in there  here drink some beer
it's cool on my tongue
you're gonna be all right
stanley listen to me i have sars there's only a ninetyeight percent chance that i will live
no dad no
listen stan sars is destroying our people the native americans put it in the blankets they gave us  soon there will be only ninetyeight percent of us left
what can i do
you must find a cure for sars son and save our people
cure sars aw jesus
the spirit of middleclass white people is strong in you son seek out the wise man in bellocreek now go go
what
hey my name's stan and i was
your coming was foretold to me you've come to save our people come in  watch the cats
uh so do you know how to cure sars
me huh no i am just a guide sit down  you must find the answer yourself by taking an inward journey
an inward journey that sounds kind of gay
let the voices of our ancestors show you the way  breathe breathe from the bag of visions
ah oh dude
how much longer must we wait for our superhighway
sars has spread through the entire town of south park chief runs with premise their wills will break soon
then i suppose we must be patient
runs with premise come quickly
what is the matter wife
it is our son premise running thin he is very sick
premise running thin what is the matter
he he shared a cup with one of the people from china he has sars
no i told you not to touch them
papa papa
i have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life but nothing seems to be working
this would never have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away no more waiting around tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan shock and awe
stanley did you have an inward journey with the old man did you have a vision
ah i don't know if i did or not i i saw something someone spoke to me and told me the middleclass white way to cure sars  campbell's chicken noodle soup dayquil and sprite
yes yes of course quickly stan we must give it to everyone
boy that really did the trick stan i thought we were kind of sort of not really done for
thanks to you we're all safe now stan
now i will blow your weak sarsinfested bodies off the earth  what the  wait a minute  stop stop  your your sars where did it go
we have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture
my son premise running thin has the sars as well  you you can cure him
it is amazing all our plants and herbs failed to heal him but your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life
we're a simple people all we want is to be allowed to live our lives
you have cured premise running thin in return i shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino  all right all right i will not build a superhighway through your town and you can all have your homes back
all right yeah  woohoo
well i guess we all learned that south park is more than just a town it's a community that nobody can split up
dude who the hell are you
alex alex glick i got to come on and do the guest voice thingy

hi mom hi dad hi joe

chef what did you do when white people stole your culture
oh well we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them
how did you do that
well like with our slang black people always used to say i'm in the house instead of i'm here but then white people all started to say in the house so we switched it to in the hizzouse hizzouse became hizzizzouse and then white folk started saying that and we had to change it to hizzie then in the hizzle which we had to change to hizzle fo shizzle and now because white people say hizzle fo shizzle we have to say flippity floppity floop
we don't have time for all that chef oh if only those queer eye for the straight guy people understood what they were doing  wait  that's it i know exactly what to do  come on mr slave let's get back to our flippity floppity floop

we shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves we should be uniting against metrophobes like these
this is crazy
crazy different outcasts call us what you want but us metros are real people just like you
you can metrobash us all you want but we're here to stay
yeah mom we're proud of who we are
that's right proud you know what i think guys i think we should have a metrosexual pride parade
great idea eric raise metrosexual awareness
we can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers
woohoohoo
come on fellas out of the malls and into the streets
out of the malls and into the streets out of the malls and into the streets out of the malls and into the streets
what the hell did that show do to them
you sure you don't want to press charges
that's okay officer i think they learned murder is wrong
especially in those pants
look guys we're sorry we tried to murder you but you have to stop what you're doing
are you crazy we're the hottest thing on tv
but don't you see the price you're selling out your own kind look us gays have created a lifestyle a a culture that is uniquely ours if we keep trying to make straight people into us well we're gonna have no identity left
sorry charlie no sale
buh but this doesn't make sense  how can gay men do this to their own people  unless you're not gay at all
you just had to push it didn't you
just had to keep asking question
now you know the truth
they aren't gay then what are they
for a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust banished by man in the kindling wars
oh my god
we are the crab people
aaaaaaaaaaaah
jesus christ
crab people crab people crab people
see now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years but soon we shall rule the land above and mankind will be gone
gone
crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force and so we came up with our perfect plan
if you can't beat man  change man
i knew it i knew gay people would never do this to their own kind
when all the world is metrosexual the crab people shall finally reign supreme
crab people crab people
taste like crab talk like people
crab people
you'll never turn me into a metrosexual i like being a dirty filthy little boy
very well if we can't make you into metrosexuals then we will make you into crab people take them
crab peopleall things just keep getting betteryou came into my lifecrab peopleand my world never looked so bright yeahcrab peopleit's true you bring out the best in mecrab peoplewhen you are around when you are aroundcrab peopleall things just keep getting bettercrab people
tom i'm standing in south park colorado where the first metrosexual pride parade is underway

it's payback time
oh my god what are they doing
oh noooo
wha what have you done
we're sorry but we didn't have a choice you see at first we liked having our men be clean and neat we thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier but it doesn't
that's right event though my steven sickens me out sometimes it's his rugged manly grossness that i'm attracted to
we're sorry but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the queer eye guys
well you're going to jail for thi  wait a minute  what is that
no our evil plans noooo
oh my god they were crab people
yes they were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world

two billion three hundred and thirty one million dollars
still want to leave token  thank you
dad can i borrow three hundred dollars
three hundred dollars what in the world for
our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in we need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of cds to listen to so we can define our sound

um sir
shiut up  you downloaded a lot of songs says here you even downlaoded judas priest that's hard time you boys are lookin' at you got anything to say for yourselves
we ddidn't think it was that big a deal
not a big deal you think downloading music for free is not a big deal put your couts on i'm gonna show you something and i don't think you're gonna like it
this is the home of lars ulrich the drummer for metallica  look there's lars now sitting by his pool
what's the matter with him
this month he was hoping to have a goldplated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool but thanks to people downloading his music for free he must now wait a few months before he can afford it  come there's more  here's britney spears' private jet notice anything  britney used to have a gulfstream iv now she's had to sell it and get a gulfstream iii because people like you chose to download her music for free  the gulfstream iii doesn't even have a remote control for its surroundsound dvd system still think downloading music for free is no big deal
we didn't realize what we were doing eh
that is the folly of man now look in this window  here you see the loving family of master p  next week is his son's birthday and all he's ever wanted was an island in french polynesia
so he's gonna get it right
i see an island without an owner if things keep going the way they are the child will not get his tropical paradise
we're sorry we'll we'll never download music for free again
man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else i fear recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semiluxury
almost there you guys
ow
why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here
because token we have to take pictures for our album cover  the key to a hotselling christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover
wow neato an album cover
this christian album better make as much money as you said it would tubby
i'm going to kill you one day token
what did you say
nothing all right guys stand over there and look wholesome and cool i have a timer on this thing so i can get in the shot too
cheese
no no haven't you guys ever seen an album cover you're supposed to be standing in random places looking away like you don't care
cheese
no butters you can't look happy on the album cover that's not cool
oh

well what's the difference you love christ you're in love with christ i mean uh what the heck is this

i'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop
certified letter for the rock band moop
that's us  dear moop this letter is to inform you that faith plus one's debut album has just sold one million copies
what
we cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony which will be held tomorrow morning at ten details and proof of sales enclosed ps nananana na na hahahaha ha ha  he did it cartman got a platinum album
is this for real this is for real
he beat us because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play
but why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars
because that's what real artists do people are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free if we're real musicians then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening
beside maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert
from now on moop isn't about money moop is about music we're not striking anymore who's with us
we're just about the money
yeah yeah
oh
so dude what are you gonna do about your bet with cartman are you gonna pay 'im
i don't have a choice dude i'm gonna swallow my pride face cartman and say congratulations you were right and i'm gonna give him the ten dollars and hopefully he won't make a big deal out of it
welcome welcome everyone please enjoy the presentation should begin shortly

ahhh this is the best day of my life
boys in recognition for over one million records sold the christian recording industry is please to present you with this myrrh album
thank you very uh wah myrrh album
i thought albums win either gold or platinum
nono in christian rock our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh congratulations

no but you can go double myrrh
god dammit
oh please don't take the lord's name in vain

good job dickhead you lost the entire audience
ah fuck you token you black asshole
hm guess he got what he deserved
fuck you eric
friends we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver
oh god memorial services are sooo boring
you insensitive asshole cartman nine people died
yeah but like eight of them were hippies mostly hippies go to farmer's markets mostly
it is sometimes hard in times like these to understand god's way why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who perhaps shouldn't be driving it is then that we must understand god's sense of humor is very different from our own he does not laugh at the simple man walks into a bar joke no god needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me all that we can hope for is that god got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again
look out
huh was that a stop sign back there  ooooh i think i hit a pothole
hey dad how come they let old people drive
well stan it's a very fragile issue
but they kill people
sometimes yes but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly stan we can't just take their licenses away
i'll be goddamned if they think they can take my license away
oooh hi dad
i heard what you said you wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors well let me tell you something peckerface i worked fifty five years in the steel mill
yes dad
and i flew spitfires over germany in world war ii
yes i know
and i will be goddamned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive
i think old people should have rights grandpa i just don't wanna die
damnit mona this isn't the fastest way to country kitchen buffet
no but it's the shortest i save the most gas that way
you save the most gas if you take the highway to country kitchen buffet
less miles means less gas you old fool
there's country kitchen right there
where
right there you're gonna miss it
is this the parking lot
i think so
another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist carl zorn of pine junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by pete and lydia malman who were trying to find country kitchen buffet this latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in deer creek where three construction workers and a bulldozer  were run down by senior citizen paul thom  who was trying to find country kitchen buffet public outcry is forcing the dmv to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy though no decision has yet to be made
seniors of south park i don't know about you but i am mad as hell
yeah
i'm sick of having my mental condition come into question
we need to let everyone know we're pissed off and we're not gonna take it anymore
yeah yeah that's right pete
that's right now can anybody remember what we're pissed off about  now remember we're all pissed about something and uh that's why we had this meeting but i can't for the life of me re
oooo was it the kids skateboarding on the sidewalks no
oh i remember they're gonna take our licenses away
yeah yeah that's right
that's right they're gonna try and take our licenses away and i for one am mad as hell
me too yeah that's right and mine too
i'm sick of having my mental condition come into question
so now what are we gonna do about it
do about what
they're gonna take our licenses away
they are they can't do that
that's right so you know what i think we should do i think we should have a senior citizens' meeting get all the seniors together at the community center and unite
great idea marvin
wait ah i think we're having that meeting right now
oh right this is the meeting
right to get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks
yeah yeah that's right someone's gotta stop them
sharon have you seen dad
he's not here hon he's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center
oh  wait a minute if all the seniors in town are at a meeting that means that when the meeting gets out
every senior in town will be driving home
at the same time  oh my god
get inside get inside  seniors' meeting getting out get off the streets
oh my goddd

awgh stan it's not that simple just relax while i find the lights here we go
how the hell did we get up here
aaaaaaahh
i told you this was the wrong way
tom i'm standing outside of the department of motor vehicles where senior citizens have until three pm to hand over their driver's licenses the new law was passed just three days after the night of horror in which all seniors were out driving at the same time causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage
alrighty   there we go next
it ain't right what you're doin' i never had an accident in my life
that's right you shouldn't punish all of us
we're sorry but this is the only way to be sure next please  there we go
but how am i supposed to get to the grocery store or the pharmacy to buy medicine
well maybe you should be in a nursing home hmmm
some of us would rather die
well we can certainly help you with that too
we aren't secondclass citizens
that's right you can take our licenses but you'll never take our pride
yeah
ooooh isn't this great you guys being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong
billy get in the car i need you boys to help me pick up my new hovaround
uh grandpa i don't think you should be driving
goddamnit billy you're supposed to listen to your dad right well i'm your dad's dad and that means you get in this car before i tan all your hides
well look at it this way statistically speaking we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside
my god he's right  hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee even though i walk through the valley of death  guys i don't know if i ever told you this but well i love you guys  except for you kyle
okay all set
oooooo my god
ah i think there's a police car behind you grandpa
eh  go around go around you moron

we're not treating you like children dad all right now i think you owe mr police officer an apology who needs to apologize hm  who's the sorrysorry
kiss my sagging ass
well fine i was gonna bail you out but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did
well i won't be sitting here long i've already called the aarp
what's that
the american association of retired persons the largest political group in the country when seniors like me are bein' discriminated against the aarp comes and sets it right  and you're gonna be sorry when they get here
and so you see children genghis khan was a mongol not to be confused with a mongoloid like the actor nicholas cage okay now who can tell me in what  year the first film by a mongoloid  that's odd  those rotc guys are way off course
more old people
the american association of retired persons
stay in your seats children i'll be right back
set up a perimeter bring bravo team to point delta
bravo team is go
move move move
let's go let's go
uh can i help you folks find something  oowww
old people gone mad
contact  put your hands up young man
marvin marsh
yes
i'm bill stewart president of the aarp huwe've come to help the seniors in this town fight back
oh it's nice to meet ya bill
huh we came as fast as we could we just had to stop by country kitchen buffet first
it's the nursing home liberate our comrades
there now mr johnson  we can go to the cafeteria and get you some creamed corn and toast  can i help you
help this  the revolution is on brother  we're taking control of the town
well alright well it's about damn time  hey everyone we're taking the town
seniors we're taking the town over
the revolution is on
the revolution
oh i'd better get my other sweater
mrs wyland seniors are taking over the town would you like a gun
oh i suppose so
what the hell is going on
shut your piehole and get over there
randy what is this
hey you are now under the authority of the aarp
ha there you go mr smartmouth look at you now
dad what are you doing
the aarp is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back
yeah and we're gonna ask for more money in medicare too
that's right
yeah
have you all got alzheimer's thethey're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens
heh  we'll tell them if they don't give us our demands we'll start killin' hostages
huh right they're gonna really believe that
isn't that a little extreme bill
heh  no we gotta be tough just like with those damned japs
this is insane dad you all need to stop right now before more people get hurt
the time when you can tell me what to do is over puckyboy we're in charge now
all right we've got control of the mayor's office and the fire station
reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in conifer
good hell us senior citizens could take over the entire country
we've got company
attention seniors lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over
mrs applegate show 'em we mean business
all right
what do you want
heh
we want our licenses back
yeah
that's right and we want more money in medicare
yeah
and we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk
yeah
hey dad
stan boys you're safe
dad why is everyone letting old people do this why doesn't somebody stop them
they've tried to stop them son but the seniors get up so early in the morning they get everything done before everyone else is even awake
they're saying something about taking over the entire country
yes and now seeing how early they get up i don't see how anyone can stop them wait a minute you boys you get up almost as early as they do you can fight them
no come on dad can't you guys do it
no son we like to sleep in
two hostages come front and center
they're coming get out of here before they see you run to the hills and find a way to fight them go  boys avenger me avenger me
all right check it out kenny did reconnaissance on the town the old people have blockades here  and here  the old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the mayor's office
so our only solution is to cut off their life force
we can't fight them cartman
no but we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply  here
country kitchen buffet
yeah you take out country kitchen buffet and old people won't know what to do
that's a retarded idea cartman
is it two years ago they closed the country kitchen buffet in steamboat springs and all the old people died of starvation in less than a week
yeah i remember hearing about that
ech even if it could work how would we go about shutting it down
i think i have a plan though we'll have to do it tonight  we'll start by sneaking into town cleverly disguised as black people  at  kenny and kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town  meanwhile stan and i sneak into the mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed nine o'clock we rendezvous at the country kitchen buffet where we strap the explosives and the timer to kyle's chest we say our tearful goodbyes to kyle and then we send him inside
yeah
all right
woohoo
aw yeah
we did it
yeah or we just go to country kitchen buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in
well right or we could always do that
all right everyone round up your ammunition and get ready to move we're takin' this war further out
all right
uh i appreciate what the aarp is tryin' to do for us but uh all we want is our licenses back
huh  heck no this is goin' too wellwe're gonna take the whole country back wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five
wipe 'em out what are you senile
come on everyone it's time to plan for phase   what the heck  huh what is this it's  am ccountry kitchen should be open
it's not open it has to be
try a window
they're blocked from the inside
no  let us in let us in
open the door it's six am
open the country kitchen buffet for us
you have to let us in
all right everyone area secure collect their weapons and free the hostages  that was a great strategy boys you may very well have saved this entire country
whoahohoooh what happened is it over
everything is fine control of the town is back to you folks
country kitchen whawhat happened
sir what should we do with this one
it's up to the townspeople
well i think he learned his lesson huh don't you feel silly now dad i think somebody owes us all an apology yes he does
oh stop it dad this is partly your fault
huh
look all grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child i think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing but how you were doing it
that's right
and grandpa you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior but you should also realize that when you're behind the wheel you're a killing machine
i know i guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families
well i think this has been a real learning experience for the marsh family people died but we all grew a bit let's just go home
sure i'll drive
that's our grandpa
dude i hate my family
dude i wonder where kyle is
maybe he caught a disease and died that'd be so awesome

oh mr marsh i am sooo sorry
we just moved here from utah and we're so used to everyone being mormon that we oh we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it oh boy you must be furious

you just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said who the heck do these people think they are i i'm really truly sorry mr marsh it won't happen again
yyou can call me randy
randy the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion we know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us
to each his own right
yeah yeah you know to be honist i've never known any mormons i don't even know what you people believe who was this joseph smith guy why did he believe that native americans are actually white people from jerusalem
well because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates right where the angel moroni said they would be
i found them i found them  you're not gonne believe it everybody i found them
found what
another new testament of jesus christ
what what did he say are you crazy
last night a native america angel told me where i could find another testament of jesus christ so i went out to the woods i dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look
maybe there isn't anything out here  wait a tick  what's this  wow
inside the stone box i found the magical seer stones under that i found four gold plates written in strange writing
this must be the gospel that jesus told the nephites
well they were the most amazing things i'd ever gazed upon
well so where are they
where are what
the gold plates and the seer stones where are they
oh oh well i was not allowed to take them you see after i found the plates the angel moroni appeared to me again and said that i am not allowed to show the plates or the seer stones to anybody because first i must translate what's written on the plates into english so you can all read it
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
wow amazing
he found the stones and golden platesdumb dumb dumb dumb dumbeven though nobody else ever saw themdumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
so how'd it go clubber lange you kicked mr harrison's ass
not exactly we're uh having their family over for dinner tomorrow night
see that's what happened to me
sharon did you know this guy joseph smith found a new testament to the bible buried here in america
what are you talking about
well it's just that the harrisons are really nice people and you should see how loving and together their family is i i think there's something to that religion
that's what they made me think too
all right that does it from now on our family is mormon
hey stan how was your date last night with the new kid

yyeah i had a question about that joseph smith guy
sure
what happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground
well he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told and then he translated what was written on the plates into the book of mormon
yeah but how
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
what's this all about mr smith
mr harris can you keep a secret
well sure i can
i have in my possession an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of jesus christ's second coming here in america
in america  really that sounds kind of
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
it's true and i'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read now ahahi know you have a lot of money mr harris and i'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs
mmm i don't know uh how do you expect to translate it
with these
rocks
they're not rocks they're seer stones given to me by an angel with them god allowed me to translate the plates into english watch you take this quill and paper and write down what i say sit here  i have the golden plates here in this hat i need to have them somewhere dark so i can read the spiritual light
really
now when i put the seer stones into the hat the ancient letter light up and change into english which i can then read to you
wow
ooo i'm seeing the light oh okay write this down and so it was that christ appeared before the nephites
and that's how the book of mormon was writtendumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb duuumb
one two three four pay one thousand dollars property tax  isn't this great you guys our first family home evening
i wanna watch tv
we're not watching tv we're mormons now and we're having family home evening
dad did you know that that joseph smith guy read the book of mormon out of a hat
and  your turn sharon
it's just that the book of mormon says a lot of strange stuff like that adam and eve lived in jackson county missouri
yes
but school taught me that the first man and woman lived in africa
well you can't believe everything school tells you stan your turn shelly  oooo that must be the harrisons
hey everybody
wow what a great house
you must be mrs marsh it's so nice to meet youuu
and you must be stan's sister oh i think your brother's the greatest
my brother is a stupid turd
hey stan
hey gary
well come on in and sit down everybody  you're here just in time my son was having a little problem with our new religion
dad
ohohoho really wel that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the joseph smith story the one that proves he was for real
yeah woohoo
ooo what's that
well you remember martin harris the rich man who wrote down what joseph smith read out of the hat
yeah
see after he was done he took some of the pages of what would become the book of mormon home
martin went home to his wifedumb dumb dumb dumb dumband showed her pages from the book of mormondumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
aand so joseph smith put his head into a hat aand read to me what the golden plates said i wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book
martin how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates
lucy harris smart smart smartsmart smart smart smart smart
why would he make it up
martin harris dumb dadumb
all right here i'm gonna hide these pages  if joseph smith really is translating off of golden plates then he'll be able to do it again but if joseph smith is making it all up then the new translations will be different from these
okay fine i bet he'll have no problem
lucy harris smart smart smartmartin harris dumbso martin went on back to smithsaid the pages had gone awaysmith got mad and told martinhe needed to go praydumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
look ah i'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on joe but i'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates
i would love to martin except i just had a vision and the lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages
he is
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
yes he is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of lehi again he's we must now translate from the plate of nephi so it will be the same basic story but written a little differently
wow if god got angry with you then you must be tellin' the truth
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
all right martin let's get to work
and that's how it happened
yeah all right
wait mormons actually know this story and they still believe joseph smith was a prophet
well sure the story proves it doesn't it
no it proves he did make it all up are you blind
well stan it's all a matter of faith
no it's a matter of logic if you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong like that the first man and woman lived in missouri and that native americans came from jerusalem then you'd better have something to back it up all you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden
hey stan don't denounce our religion
i don't wanna be mormon dad
me neither
hey that's only cool guys you can believe whatever you want
yeah it's great you have your own beliefs
yeah hooray for the marshes
oh stop it  that's another thing why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time it isn't normal you just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my dad
yeah
well kids who's up for a water balloon fight
yeah all right
oh hey stan where's your best buddy gary
i'm not hanging around that kid anymore
oh no you guys broke up
you guys were right okay the new kid's a douche now i just gotta find a way to keep him away from me
hey stan
oh brother
uh oh the jilted lover returns
listen i just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore
i don't
look maybe us mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense and maybe joseph smith did make it all up but i have a great life and a great family and i have the book of mormon to thank for that the truth is i don't care if joseph smith made it all up because what the church teaches now is loving your family being nice and helping people and even though people in this town might think that's stupid i still choose to believe in it all i ever did was try to be your friend stan but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back you've got a lot of growing up to do buddy suck my balls
damn that kid is cool huh
m'kay kids can i have it quiet please m'kay m'kay quiet now the assembly's about to start m'kay m'kay quiet plemkm'kay  m'kay uh now kids we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking m'kay so please give a very big south park cows welcome to butt out

mom  dad it was just a
i don't have a son
eric you've done a lot of horrible things in your life but smoking you're grounded for three weeks
three weeks are you fucking kidding me
haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you
of course they haven't because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first this is really their fault
yeah this is really their fault
no matter how much money the antismoking groups spend the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke
yeah huh  itit's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind no must fight it tobacco companies making me want to smoke ah
oh my goodness i had no idea  are you okay sweetie
well those goddamned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over my kid i say we bring them down
we need the help of the greatest antismoking celebrity that ever lived rob reiner
who's rob reiner
i don't understand it i pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes i lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art i forced smokers out of bars and parks but still i get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it  apparently people still don't understand how bad smoking people is for them don't they know how dangerous it is to their health  don't they know the hazard of secondhand smoke
according to the letter sir the town has a tobacco company quite near them
yeah that must be it  the tobacco companies with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings  they're the ones making music wanna smoke  they're the ones hurting our nation's health i will not stand by and see the children of america corrupted by those bastards  this is war
you guys maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke
hwat
why it's perfect if everyone's blaming the tobacco companies then nobody's blaming us
yeah what's the problem
well it's just that eh this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands you know it's been happening a lot lately how about this time we just put a stop to it right now
dumbass you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks do you
yeah don't worry dude things aren't gonna get out of hand
here he comes
damnit  butter  butter
what'd he say
butter  hello south park  it is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health and i'm gonna help ya  these poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco so i say we fight fire with fire we're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down
oh no
alright kids here's what we're gonna do  we're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper  once you're inside mm mm i'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking got it
got it
but isn't that kind of lying
mm  uh we're just leveling out the playing field  the tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking if we're gonna take them down we've gotta lie right back  oh my god  excuse me
yes
would you mind putting that death stick out
but uh this is a bar
isn't smoking illegal in bars here
not in colorado
oh my god what kind of backward hick state is this
look man i work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill i just got off work and i need to relax
well when i relax i just go to my vacation house in hawaii
i ain't got a vacation house in hawaii
yuh your vacation house in mexico then whatever it is look you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here and i'm not gonna tolerate it i will end smoking in bars in colorado there will be no more smoking here
isn't he awesome you guys
what
dude he just goes around imposing his will on people he's my idol
all right boys just do what i tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars  as soon as we get into the main facility i'll snap the photo of you kids and we can all run out think you can handle it
handle it for two billion dollars i'd handle my grandpa's balls sir
heh great  okay now watch yourselves kids these tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking they are liars and they are frauds
can i help you
yes my name is rita poon i called about my boys wanting a tour
ah yes mrs poon my name's kevin harris and i'm the vice president of big tobacco
oh hello mr harris
well come on in  how about a little history first  native americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant they smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes
not if i were around they wouldn't have
excuse me
oh nothing please continue
the first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in virginia in   within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports
so tobacco helped to build america
that's right over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from africa to help work the fields
which means if it weren't for tobacco many of our black friends wouldn't be here today
and so for centuries tobacco production flourished nobody was even aware of any dangers back then until in   when congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the surgeon general's warning on their packages so now everyone knows the dangers of smoking and some people still choose to do it and we believe that's what being an american is all about
that sound perfectly reasonable
and here's our factory at work
with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey laywe work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey dayso folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey livesand relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
i like to have a cigarette every now and then it makes me feel calmer when the day is at an end
and if it gives me cancer when i'm eighty i don't carewho the hell wants to be ninety anyway
so with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey laywe work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey dayso folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey livesand relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
well i guess that's the end of our tour
oh here boys let me get your picture  got it ha you bastards are going down now
what
i'm not rita poon i'm rob reiner  and you've just been reinered come on boys let's make our escape  don't you try and stop us
oh my god
hoh boy that was great kids
those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice
hah you see that they got into your head now you kids can meet some good decent people the folks who work to get smoking banned
this is how we get rid of smokers  we go state to state and do things like use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop
wow it's like it's like smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and and you get to take that away from them  you are so awesome
here you go bob  this is mr baffrey he does all our photoshop work  now all we have to do is photoshop cigarettes into your hands  and bingo when this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed hahahaha
but dude you're making stuff up
you kids need to understand something okay sometimes lying is okay like when you know what's good for people more than they do
oh my god that is what i've always said  i love this guy
mr reiner your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass
what  goddamnit what the hell is wrong with people in this state
apparently several people here still believe there's no proof secondhand smoke can kill you
well they want proof all right we'll give them proof boys i need one of you to act in a commercial for us we'll shoot it tomorrow
wow a commercial
and you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part all right people we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in potsdam let's go
god he's just the best  mr reiner can i get you a muffin oor a cold drink perhaps
guys i think we should bail out of this right now
huh
this is just startin' to look like another one of those times where itit's gonna end up with the whole town turning out it's a big showdown happening and us havin' to talk about what we learned and i say we just stop right now and go play cards or something
well yep that's what i think
yeah maybe you're right
so heh gentlemen looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial huh who will it be gentlemen the game is on
go ahead we don't wanna be in their stupid commercial
huh oh i get it kyle that's your serbian jew double bluff make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe i won't either ooops didn't work did it kyle
no we really want nothing more to do with these people
sure you don't kyle oh and neither do i oh i know what you're gonna say next you're gonna say how about none of us show up tomorrow to do it and then i'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial that's serbian jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha  only one of us can be in the commercial gentlemen the game is on
sorry kyle but i'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow hahahaha thought you had me with your serbian jew double bluff didn't you well let's see you try to open this door now  hahahahaha haa haa hahahahahaha haa haa haha
what are you doing
oh hello kyle oh man  wait this isn't my house
cartman you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow but i'm warning you those antismoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want and that means they're dangerous
hahahahahaha  nice try kyle let's see you try to get through the door now haa haa hahahahaha
okay eric this is going to be real simple all you gotta do is read the words on the teleprompter here
heh hookay
let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this  all right roll camera roll the teleprompter and whenever you're ready eric
heh okay okay  you know some people say there's no proof that secondhand smoke kills the tobacco companies say there's no proof that secondhand smoke kills i've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer i guess i'm the proof the next time you want to believe that secondhand smoke doesn't kill think about me because by the time you see this commercial i'll be dead  dead
and cut great we got it wrap it up people that was fantastic
uh what what does that mean i'll be dead hey uh what what was that dead part
that was very good eric here eat this cupcake
uh nnno thanks i'm not hungry
but you are just eat this one cupcake it has sprinkles
i'm not eating the cupcake
eric do you know what a hero is a hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others you can be a hero eric all you have to do is eat the cupcake
jesus christ haaaa
hey
what are you doing cartman
they're going to kill me
who's going to kill you
the antismoking people they had me say i died from secondhand smoke and now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real they'll stop at nothing
well get away from us then
yeah dude don't get us killed too
you guys have to help me
no dude get away
please you guys i don't know what to do
stop it cartman go die on your own
if i go you guys go
daaaad
what
antismoking people are trying to kill cartman and he won't stay away from us
don't be ridiculous boys the antismoking people are kind caring and intelligent your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies
hey maybe that's it you guys maybe the tobacco company can help us
help you fatass we weren't in the commercial remember
yeah go to the tobacco company yourself
well that's fine i thought you guys were my friends but i guess i was wrong
yeah dude you were totally wrong
uh huh
you guys i am seriously gettin' pissed off heh now come on we're goin' to the tobacco company
oh all right
no what we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves even if it means getting grounded
why
because if we go to the tobacco company i know exactly what'll happen they'll take us in and then rob reiner will show up with all the townspeople holding torches or something and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned and change everyone's minds  this is all following a formula
so it's either deal with all that or be grounded for three weeks
goddamnit
give us the child
we will not
there you see that the tobacco company won't give us the kid and do you know why because they know that if they give us that kid then we'll kill him and when our commercial goes on the air it will lose them business
yeah yeah that's right
wait a minute what
yeah when we kill the kid people are gonna think it's because of secondhand smoke and then these bastards are all gonna make money and they know it
wha what the hell is wrong with you that's not right
oh goddamnit do i have to explain this again smoking is bad people so if we have to be a little extreme to stop it it's okay
no it isn't you fat turd because i've learned something today you just hate  see i knew it
yup
you just hate smoking so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you and that's called fascism you tubby asshole
goddamnit there'll be no more smoking
it wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked it was our fault us we should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do
you're right boys m'kay
yeah let smokers smoke
yeah
hey mr reiner why don't you butt out
i'm warning you don't mess with antismoking groups
i don't idolize you anymore asshole
my goo my precious goo
so kyle it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke
no
well then you are grounded mister

aw awww
well i guess we learned our lesson
no we didn't dude no we didn't

there's nothing else i can do she was my whole life
aw come on dude all you've done for the last four days is mope around you might as well hang out with those goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time
maybe i should at least they will understand me maybe i should hang with the goth kids
life is pain life is only pain  we're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings  but there's only blackness dark depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul
who needs that kind of barbie love anyway everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirtyfour thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium they're all zombies racing to their graves love didn't work for my mom and dad why should it work for me
my dad is such an asshole drunken bastard doesn't even know i exist but then he won't let me go to the skinny puppy concert because my heroineaddict aunt is coming over for dinner  dinner that's a laugh just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the britney spears wannabes at this school
they're all a bunch of nazi conformists cheerleaders
but if life is only pain then what's the point of living
just to make life more miserable for the conformists
all right so how do i join you
if you wanna be one of the nonconformists all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do
'k
okay i know it's your first day ferrari so i wanna go over the basics with you
okay
first of all there's a five foot rule if you come within five feet of a customer you need to acknowledge them even if they're not at your table hey  cutie  when you're not serving food or talking with customers you need to dance around and have fun  we use things like hula hoops silly strings and water guns to play with the other girls be sure to giggle a lot and be sure to show off your raisins  now when you take a customer's order you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested write your name down for them and make them feel special oh man i am so bored thank god you guys came in if you want good tips the most important thing is physical contact just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars i'll be right back with your order guys
wow thank you so much mercedes

gerald broflovski
yes
my name is harry gints and this is my wife elise we're from canada
yes i can tell
my wife and i had a child a few years back and we weren't ready to have a child so we put him up for adoption  we were told that you might be the
peter  oh god harry it's our son  peter it's mommy
gerald what the hell is going on
i i'm not sure
it was a tough time for us it was a tough time for all of canada the whole country was devastated by the cola wars it just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby
so we put him up for adoption but as the years passed i i just felt an emptiness in my heart  oh it's so good to see him
well we wish you all the best mr and mrs gints but to be honest i think it would be best for ike if you didn't come around again
i don't think you understand we didn't come to visit peter we came to take him back
what
we want to take peter home to canada
are you crazy
look you gave ike up you can't just change your mind
changing your mind is a canadian custom that we hold quite dear and besides the new canadian prime minister has issued a decree that all adopted canadians must be returned home
the new canadian prime minister
look ike is our son now
he doesn't belong here he belongs in canada with his own kind
i think you'd better leave
please don't make things any harder for peter
harder for peter now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to canada and we're being hard on peter
we're prepared to go to court we had hoped it wouldn't come to that
well you bet your ass it'll come to that
i'm sorry to say that my hands are tied the new prime minister of canada has authority this court cannot override by canadian law i must award custody of the child to his birth parents
yes
yes
no
ike's not my little brother anymore
gerald do something
there's nothing i can do
goodbye ike you  be a good bye huh you remember all the things we taught you
ike you'll always be my little brother okay
come on peter we should get going
no
peter you must come with mommy and daddy
no no no no no
i have some chocolate
chocolate
we're going to take good care of him
you'd better  dad can't we talk to this new canadian prime minister iif he knew the situation he might e
oh kyle appealing to the prime minister of canada would take time and money we don't have
dude look at that sprinkle time make your own marshmallow factory i'm definitely asking for that for christmas
dude i'm gonna tell my parents to get me that john elway doll with the karatechop action
guys  guys i need your help
sure dude
it's been a week since ike's been gone and every day my parents seem worse i have to try to go to canada and speak with the new canadian prime minister but i can't do it alone
we can't go to canada dumbass it's christmas
yeah dude what if we miss out on some great christmas adventure
please you guys you don't understand  my family is devastated my mom just walks around the house like a zombie and my dad can't stop crying
well i didn't wanna say anything kyle but i think this is what your family gets for being jewish at christmastime
dude cartman
i'm just saying maybe jesus is having a little revenge that's all
i found the number for a really cheap airline to canada if we go as soon as possible then
dude we just can't up and go to canada look they're about to light the christmas tree maybe you can get your brother back some other way
kyle i just want you to know if it were any other time of the year i still wouldn't help you
three two one  yaaaaay
as we celebrate this glorious time we can't forget those families who are suffering as many of you know the broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them as a community we must do all we can to ease their pain are there any suggestions how we might help
how about we get rid of all the mexicans
mr garrison every christmas you suggest we get rid of all the mexicans and every christmas we tell you no
rats
the broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new canadian prime minister what if this christmas instead of buyin' presents we all use that money to give to the broflovskis
ha yeah right like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for christmas
that's a great idea chef
what
yeah who needs more stuff anyway this christmas we can do somethin' that really matters
dad don't get carried away
then it's settled this year we'll give all our christmas money to the broflovskis in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them
no no this can't be happening
you fucking asshole this is all your fault
what
everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying christmas presents  you fucking jews ruined christmas again  aaaaaa

in our last episode the four ninjas did battle with professor chaos bringer of destruction and doom it was during that great battle that ninja master kenny threw his star into professor chaos' eye now the ninjas were in serious trouble because their parents might find out they had weapons if professor chaos told on them while trying to get professor chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office the four ninjas ran into craig and his three friends they challenged the four ninjas to fight and the legendary battle of tokutawa began it was during this battle that professor chaos escaped and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with craig and his friends to find professor chaos or else they would all be grounded

we have come to return the weapons we purchased
uh sorry kids ah i don't give refunds
listen doucher our parents are gonna kill us and you if they found out that we bought these
i thought you told me your parents were dead
you guys  you guys
what is it craig
it's butters we saw 'im
where
right on the other side of the fairgrounds he's just wandering around aimlessly
then it's not too late
come on ninjas
all right folks our next item up for bids is this lovely th century lamp
aw dude crap all our parents are there
butters is right on the other side
we have to get past them
all right looks like i have to use my power of invisibility to get by
you have that power too
i told you bulrog has lots and lots of powers behold  this way i can move about the crowd of people undetected  here hold this stuff for me
good luck bulrog
now this lamp comes from the estate of edna and james hollinger who lived in upstate wyoming  it has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base this is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique  the lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars  so we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five do i do i hear three hundred and seventy five  kid what the hell do you think you're doin'
haba haba habahoaha
butters
what happened to him
oh my god
oh jesus
oh dude we are gonna get it now
all right people we are all extremely upset over what's happened  but let's try to speak one at a time
well like the rest of you i am shocked and appalled at what happened i don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in but something has to change
yeah i agree
this is the worst thing that's happened in this town  the worst thing
yeah i mean there were children watching that auction and when that little eightyearold boy walked up and flashed his penis it was an outrage
what
what
not only that the auction was televised on public access so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the penis how am i supposed to explain that to her
this is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down
you see the damage you've caused eric cartman what were you thinking
i told you it was a wardrobe malfunction
dude they don't care we knocked butters' eye out with weapons
just run with it dude
uh yeah i agree uh my fragile little eightyearold mind didn't know how to deal with what i was seeing ccartman should be punished
yeah
hey fuck you kyle
yeah i c i can't believe it
yeah i guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about
so i guess this means we get to keep our weapons
yeah come on ninjas  we've got some more work to do
hya
hey fellas
oh hey jimmy hey timmy
timmy

weeell uh maybe i can help you out you know there are shortcuts
what kind of shortcuts
you know steroids
sssssssteroids  but aren't those illegal
yeah sure but these are new they don't show up in our urine tests
so uh hahow do they wwwork
you just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals
how much would this cost me
uuuh it isn't cheap i've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas
well then maybe i'll just use them aallittle bit you know as a performance en hancer
oh whatever you say jimmy my friend  whatever you say
you guys you guys i have the best idea ever i'm gonna be rich
what
dude i was just looking at the special olympics brochure and check this shit out at the end of the special olympics a grand champion special athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of
so
so so dude think about it if somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks
oh no cartman no
it's flawless i'll act like i have a disability and when the time come to compete i'll kick ass against all the handicaps
that's really really terrible dude
terrible whatever you guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can it'll work you'll see
cartman i will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the special olympics
why
because
what are you gonna do kyle tell on me  then you'll be a great big nogood doublefaced poopypants tattletale  is that really how you deal with your problems grow up kyle  all i have to do is make people think i'm handicapped and i get a thousand dollars it won't be easy but nothing worth having ever is

enter
cartman i really really have a problem with what you're doing i object to it morally and i find it grossly offensive
go on kyle
i know that i often have serious moral objections to the things that you do but this time i think you really need to reconsider because if you do this i believe you will go to hell so i feel it is my responsibility as your friend to tell people what you're doing and to put a stop to it
well kyle i understand where you're coming from and i appreciate you being so direct um the thing is you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're jewish now kyle you haven't gone to see mel gibson's film the passion but
i didn't come here to talk about the passion cartman
let me finish if you had seen the passion you would know that hell is reserved for the jews and all those who don't accept christ that being the case it is actually me who is worried about your soul
i came here to talk about you
yes  and instead you had to break through yourself this is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life kyle  good luck
come on push it push it  yeah nice ppecs sweet bbiceps
jimmy i thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop

timmih '
what
timmih '
oh my god youyou're right timmy you're totally right  everyone can i have your attention please  i'm afraid i have to give back my medal the truth is i haven't been playing fair either i've been using ststeroids i was willing to do anything to be the best and the steroids made me blind to the people i was hurting  a good friend even tried to talk me out of it and i wouldn't listen to him  taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the special olympics  because you're taking all the fairness out of the game but i know now that even if you do win on steroids you're really not a winner you're just a ppussy you're just a  big fat pppussy and if you take steroids the only decent thing to do is come forward and say  remove me from the record books because i am a big stinky ppussy   steroidtaking jackass  that's how i feel about myself and why i must decline this medal and my place in the history books and if you'll let me i'll be back next year to compete with honor  '
hey kid good for you for being honest
well guys i guess now you see what i was up to all along i dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the special olympics on purpose so that jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids  eh oh yeah we well you guys are assholes  grow up

we go to church to learn that stuff we go to movies to be entertained we weren't entertained and we want our money back
i'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie you'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers
wwhat mel gibson you're saying we have to get our money back from mel gibson

no no no no we want our money back
what
we think the movie sucked and we want mel gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars do you know how we can get in touch with him
you thought it sucked sir apparently you don't understand what mel gibson was trying to do he was trying to express through cinema the horror and filthiness of the common jew it has made people the world over open their eyes
look kid we just thought it was a bad movie so tell us how to get in touch with mel gibson so we can get our money back
if i knew where mel gibson was i'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment sir all i know is he lives somewhere in malibu now stop wasting me and mel gibson's time you little wussy prick

eric sweetie there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting
yeah mom i'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved the passion as much as i did
oh that's great sweetie
tell them i'll be down shortly
okay hon
tten sie die juden wir knnen nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind okay i'm ready i'm ready to do thy bidding mel gibson
hello are you folks holding this passion meeting
no actually we're guests as well i'm jack garrett and this is my wife elise
hello
i think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this
oh i agree there are so many of us who are moved by the passion it's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the christian community
and apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film
leave it to a child to show us all the way huh
yeah so i see this ad on the internet saying if you love the passion to come to this meeting so here i am
it's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use the passion to enrich everyone's lives
ah hello everyone achtung  my name is eric cartman and i'm the president of the mel gibson fan club  ah thank you thank you i'm happy to see that all of youwere affected by the passion like i was now we all know why we're here and i believe we all what needs to be done
we sure do
but i think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps
wha what does that mean sweetie
i'm not sure but uh  folks i just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together the passion is causing a revolution of spirituality and we owe mel gibson and this little boy our thanks
thank you thank you very much now in order to do what we  all know needs to be done we are first going to need more support i think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see the passion
oh what a great idea we each make it our responsibility to convert one more person
heheh great yeah great idea
yes and then we can begin the cleansing if you know what i mean
we sure do
yeah all right woohoo
thank you  this must be the place  goddamn mel gibson must be loaded
yes
oh hi uh my name is stan and this is kenny
hello
uh we saw your movie the passion and we didn't like it so can we have our money back please
you can't not like the passion i just followed the bible christ died for you go home
look dude we came a long way we're not leaving until you give us our money
oh yeah well you're gonna have to find it first  but i won't tell you where i keep my money  you can torture me all you want i still won't tell you
tor torture you
ha so you do intend to torture me huh  well go ahead do your worst  you still won't get your ticket money back i can take whatever you can dish out
we don't want to torture you
i get it but you don't have a choice is that it well go ahead i just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall
dude can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you
i have to use that money to build my church i brought the fire and brimstone back to christianity with the passion and now i'm gonna start my own church and do you know why so i can play banjo  jesus oh how i love ya how i love ya jesus
dude this guy is freakin' daffy
how dare you call me crazy this means war
and so it was that god sent his only son down from heaven to die for our sins
oh okay but did god sent jesus to die or did jesus just get kind of screwed over
what is troubling you my child
well i have this friend see and this friend belongs to a certain chosen people of israel and it so happens that these chosen people killed your lord
ah you mean he's a jew
right but he can't live with the guilt anymore because even if jesus wasn't really the son of god he was still a nice guy and he didn't deserve what happened to him in mel gibson's movie i i can't sleep at night i mean my friend can't sleep at night
yes the passion is very powerful the truth is there's not a whole lot in the bible about the crucifixion the passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the middle ages to incite people against the jews
but how can the jews make it better
well if you really care about your friend's soul then perhaps show him the way of jesus remember christianity is about atonement
wait that's it atonement of course  i know what i have to do now thank you father
aaaah
two days ago i saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker you wanna get outta here talk to me
mel gibson is fucking crazy dude  wait there's his wallet
freedom
awww crap he's only got twenties you got two dollars kenny
jesus is lord gt gt
all right let's get the hell out of here
when you're a clown nobody takes you seriously
aah run dude run
k'plagh k'plagh and good evening frieeeeeeends
one month ago today this amazing film opened in theaters and now we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message  fellow fans of mel gibson our numbers have grown and now together we have the power to change the world  now i believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie
woah great idea
it'll be like a parade
good idea
and as we march for the passion we should also voice our support so when i say es ist zeit fr suberung you all chant back wir mssen die juden ausrotten
well what does that mean dear
oh i think it's aramaic you know like in the movie
ooo aramaic cool
neato that'll be awesome great
what was our aramaic line again
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit fr rache
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
oh this is fun
all right everyone forward march  es ist zeit fr rache
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit fr rache
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
nice
shalom hak nak shalom and now one of our fine young shlokas kyle broflovski has asked if he could speak to the congregation
thank you rabbi  in  the united states officially issued an apology to the african american community for slavery in  germany officially apologized for world war ii and the holocaust and now i believe in  the jewish community needs to apologize for the death of jesus
what
whatwhatwhaaat
if we as a people choose not to believe that jesus is the son of god then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed and take our share of the responsibility for it
oh my god
kyle what on earth has gotten into you
i saw the passion
oh no the passion
this proves the antisemitic effect that movie is having
yeah it makes jews into stereotypes
stereotyping jews is terrible
something must be done to stop that movie
now now everyone calm down we live in a rational community and everyone knows this is just a movie there's no cause for alarm
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit fr rache
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit fr rache
wir mssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit fr rache
well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty seven dollars getting our money back from mel gibson  but i think it's the principle of the thing that matters
yeah i agree
oh you've got to be shittin' me
give me back my money
goddamn that guy's crazy  hey dude you've gotta speed up
huh
mel gibson is chasing after us you've gotta go faster
haha very funny kid sit down and stop playing games
i'm not playing games mel gibson is right behind you and he's gonna
what the hell
haaaa k'plaaaa
hey that's mel gibson
yeah i told you that
well what the hell does he want
he wouldn't give us our money back for the passion so we kinda took it
you didn't like the passion but it shows how christ suffered for you mel gibson is a very spiritual man
both you guys stop please you're gonna make people hate us more
can i help you
this movie is causing antisemitism you must remove it from your theater
that's right yeah remove your movie
remove it from the theater fat chance
we demand you stop showing it
yeah yeah
no no no don't become an angry mob  the last time we did that we killed jesus
juden
what's going on here
they're trying to have the passion pulled from the theater
this film is antisemitic and it must be stopped
nonsense mel gibson is a smart and spiritual man there's nothing antisemitic about it
it has reaffirmed all of our faith in christ
it's made one of our little jewish boys want to apologize for the death of jesus
well maybe you should apologize
that's right what he said
how dare you
look out
give me my eighteen dollars
mel gibson  oh mein savior mein fhrer you're actually here mr gibson i have assembled the masses we are ready to do thy bidding  have i been a good boy mr gibson
ha  so you boys have led me here to your secret base huh i guess now you're gonna start torturing me well  oh my nipples are so tender don't squeeze them anymore
that's mel gibson
h he's not quite as eloquent as i had pictured
yeah  i'll bet you wanna torture me now don't you
dude what's wrong with him
he's kookoo dude he's absolutely out of his mind
you you would all love to torture me wouldn't you  okay fine see what you can fit in there i can take it
dude i've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie
fine if nobody here is man enough to torture me then just give me my eighteen dollars
it's our eighteen dollars your movie sucked
you can't say my movie sucked or else you're saying christianity sucked
no dude if you wanna be christian that's cool but you should follow what jesus taught instead of how he got killed focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the dark ages and it ends up with really bad results
you know he's right elise we shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of christ
yeah lots of people got crucified in those times we shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith
aw aw no come on people we're so close to completing my final solution
oh dude i feel so much better about being jewish now that i see that mel gibson is just a big wacko douche
woohoohoo woohoohoohoohoo

what do you want

sorry stan i'm not a dancer anymore  i gave that up
your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country
did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed

look butters accidents happen we all have to live with that
i let those people down don't you get it man eight people died
well it was nine actually one of the women was pregnant
what
and eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward
aaaah
but that isn't the point butters  the point is that this is now it's on and there are people who need you to step up look nobody likes having to rise to a challenge but competing against other people and getting in their faces saying haha i'm better than you is part of life and if you can't face that then you might as well sit here and play legos until you're an old man
get out of my room stan

come on awesomo we're gonna go a sightseein'
argh
i'm hangin' out in la with my robot friendwe're havin' such fun in the hot hot sunwe're two of a kind that's meand my robot friendmy robot friendmy robot friend
can you believe we're at a real live movie studio awesomo aren't we havin' the best time
butters wouldn't you like to have some time away from awesomo we could meet up later perhaps
hey look over there awesomo the film studio commissary  that's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh hollywood blockbusters have their lunch neato huh
damnit mitch how come our movie studio can't come up with any winners i mean we're smart right
we're really smart
we need an idea for a movie that's a home run a feelgood romp for the whole family  hey what's that over there
wow that's a really neat little robot you have there little boy
what's he do
well he can do anything watch this hey awesomo who's gonna win the super bowl next year
the new orleans saints
hey mr robot how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
seventeen
mitch are you thinkin' what i'm thinkin'
yeah maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas
exactly
gentlemen this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot the awesomo   i've already seen what it can do
uh excuse me sir but uh that's not a robot
it's not
no it clearly had bipedal movement so the correct term is computerized automatron
oh very nice mitch
you are the smart one
well regardless i believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas
how can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us
watch this awesomo given the current trends of the moviegoing public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office
um okay how about this  adam sandler is like in love with some girl but then it turns out that the girl is actually a golden retriever or something
oh perfect
we'll call it puppy love
give us another movie idea awesomo
yeah yeah
let's hear it
yeah we wanna hear it
come on come on
okay how about this adam sandler inherits like a billion dollars but first he has to like become a boxer or something
yes it's flawless
punchdrunk billionaire
boy los angeles is great huh awesomo can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas
you should split that money with awesomo after all they were awesomo's ideas
hahaa right what are you gonna do with money awesomo buy some robot pants haha no we got each other and that's all we need awesomo i'm gonna send this money to needy kids in thirdworld countries
haaaa haaaa
yoe you okay awesomo
awesomo needs to rest feeling faint
well you go ahead and relax awesomo we've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow
gentlemen ladies we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty the risk of an attack on american soil is higher than ever now i believe we may be able to curb that risk two days ago our intelligence department came across this  the awesomo  it is currently being used by catamount pictures to develop ideas for movies our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas eight hundred of which feature adam sandler
that's incredible
you're thinking the robot could be used to come up with antiislamic movies
no if we got our hands on that robot we could reprogram it and turn it into a weapon
yes that might be the best thing to do
uh huh i don't see how we have a choice
hold on a second if that robot is designed for entertainment then turning it into a weapon is unethical
unethical let me explain something to you mr scientist we understand that the robot is from japan that means that the japanese have more of them and if the japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do
jesus it would be pearl harbor all over again
but worse with robots
i i'm sorry i must protest we we have no data suggesting the japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability
you're paid to think mr scientist national security is our jub  gentlemen we're going to los angeles  i want that robot
yeah me and my robot are still over at the movie studio aunt nellie we're makin' all sorts of money for the poor
movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five adam sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut
great awesomo great uh guys take a break i need a minute alone with awesomo  you are an incredible robot awesomo i was just wondering are you by chance a pleasure model
what
well have you been programmed to satisfy urges of humans
awesomo does not understand
let me show you what i mean
well yeah we're havin' a great time aunt nellie these movie studio guys are real nice
lame
yeah we're makin' a bunch more money i can't believe it either
not cool totally lame
awesomo well i gotta go aunt nellie ah awesomo is havin' some kind of malfunction  awesomo hey where'd ya go
waaaaa
let's go move move
awesomo  hey what are you doin' with him  that's my robot  awesomoooooooooooooo
are those arm and leg locks secure
secure sir
good i don't want that robot mobile until i know what it's capable of all right power it on
whoa whoa wha whoa whoa
what the hell
what's going on
it powered itself back on
stand by be ready to destroy it
where the hell am i hey why can't i move
are your systems stable run a systems check on your cpu
the fuck are you talkin' about dude
ah i'm sorry robot  they want me to reprogram you
i'm not a robot dumbass i'm alive
what did you say
i said i'm a real person asswipe
oh my god
what's happening
the robot it thinks it's alive it's developed consciousness
what how can that be
must be a malfunction of its exographical ims or the interlaced bv system
speak in a language we can understand mr scientist
your robot doesn't know it's a robot
goddamnit get me down from here
who made you robot
i'm not a robot i'm a human
jesus the scientist was right
but who would have programmed it to think it was human the movie studio
look retards my name is eric cartman i live with my mom in south park colorado
dear christ they gave it memories too
sure why not program the memories of some eightyearold boy who doesn't exist and make the robot think he's real makes for a lot better movies i'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness
do i have to remind you of your position don't forget you have a duty to your country  mr scientist i want that robot's memories and consciousness erased so we can take it back to washington got it
damn you all to hell
hey there did you know i had a robot friendwe used to laugh and play but someone took him awayhe was my ten gigahertz old palmy robot friend
hey wait a minute  why that's the van that  oh my god
goddamnit stop i'm real i'm real
it'll all be over soon robot
hang on i'm getting you out of here robot
aw it's about freaking time jackass
what the hell are you doing
well i i'm saving a conscious being if you wanna kill it you'll have to go through me
fine kill that son of a bitch
no look goddamnit now i can show you stupid assholes who i really am
awesomo
i am the awesomo
no  no please  don't kill him he's my best friend he's my best friend in the whole world
there you see you want to tell me this isn't humanity who's to judge what makes something human anyway  does this make me human  or this  or these
perhaps there is consciousness in this robot maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence is intelligence all the same and we can learn from the robots i think maybe one day we can all  hey wait a minute did did that robot just fart
hey robots don't fart
uh now ending fart sequence
oh and it it smells too
smell sequence initiated

johnson what about you
placing the blood spatter now sir
frakes
placing pubic hair from the raped girl now sir
all right when this jefferson guy shows up arrest him fast and try not to beat him there could be neighbors with video cameras  why do we do it harris
sir
why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy africanamericans with crimes they didn't commit
oh why i guess i never thought about why sir we just do it
twentyfive years i've been on the force i've seen every kind of sick depraved act known to humanity and still when i see a black man walk by who has more money than me i want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter but why maybe there is no reason maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride
stan time to get up for school  stan what the  mr jefferson
oh oh we were just having a slumber party
mr jefferson this is highly inappropriate
inappropriate no you're being ignorant they're my friends you see i i didn't have a childhood so i'm really just a child myself  here everything's okay i want you each to have a hundred dollars
wow i'm gonna go buy that new sport coat i've been wanting
come on blanket we have to go home and feed the animals bye friends
boys i do not want you going over to mr jefferson's anymore do you understand
you don't have to tell us twice mom that guy's a freak
not go to mr jefferson's anymore well excuse my french mrs marsh but you can suck my fat hairy balls
come on blanket
hey har har harris harris
wha wha what
it's jefferson he's back  all right people let's give blacky a nice welcome home  whoa wait a minute  that guy isn't black  holy god his son isn't black either oh jesus  this is yates stand down i repeat stand down suspect is not black  you son of a bitch you told my this guy was africanamerican
it says right here on the final sheet he is
does that look like a black guy to you
it said on the final sheet
jesus christ monkeyballs we could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black oh  wuuugh wuugh ohaugh ugh  jesus harris what are we becoming we're supposed to protect the people where have we lost our way
sir it's possible that he is black even though he doesn't look it
to hell with you i'm never gonna frame an innocent man again unless i know he's black for sure
all the adults are trying to get us get up to your room blanket and put your mask on we can't go outside anymore
that poor kid
dude come on we're not supposed to go over there
hi guys
hey blanket uh look we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood you wanna come with
really you mean it
oh yay my friends are here come inside and play guys
ah actually mr jefferson we were seeing if blanket wanted to chop wood with us
chop wood no that's ignorant that's poopie work blanket and me wanna play
mr jefferson uh it might be good for blanket to learn how to chop wood
blanket likes to play don't you blanket  wee look he can fly
jesus christ dude
aaaaaah
stop you fucking lunatic
dude we have got to get that kid away from him
no blanket shhhh stop crying it's okay blanket here look  jeekabee durtah  ow  there blanket shhhh  hey hey look hey look  i got your nose  look lookit i got your nose i got your nose blanket see
aaaaaaaah
no blanket stop  it's ignorant you're being ignorant
harrison why haven't you called you know how i worry
i'm givin' up maggie i'm quitting the force
quitting the force you
none of it makes sense anymore  i don't even know if what we're doing is right the last thirteen hours we've been working on a case trying to get a real scumbag off the streets and when he walked up to the door i could have sworn he was white maybe i can't tell the difference anymore maybe it doesn't matter because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy he's back out on the streets in no time it's just like oj do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him the tireless hours they put in and then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the n word out loud too many times i guess i'm just tired i'm just damn tired
not another word of that kind of talk harrison yates  believe me i would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home but i know you framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood wiping that rich smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours you're a good cop harrison yates you don't have to question that because i'm here to tell you
and you're a good wife maggie you know me better than i know myself
where're you goin'
think i've got a little more work to do
mr jefferson it's your best friend in the whole wide world eric cartman mr jefferson i came to sleep over tonight remember
no dr nelson i'm telling you you have to fly out here right now my nose came off again  i know you live in california i'll pay for your plane ticket  but i'm falling apart i need some more of that cream and the injections i have to look young again  oh i'm melting
all right thanks a lot for helping us dude
yeah sure whatever
you just gotta pretend you're blanket until we can get the real blanket somewhere safe
aren't i too big to be blanket
i don't think mr jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice come on
blanket you in here
hi guys
shh blanket we're gonna take you away for a little while okay
you are oh thank you thank you thank you
all right dude get in his bed
all right but you guys owe me for this
dude whatever at least you finally get to do something
santa barbara police department this is snetzl
hello this is sergeant yates over at the park county police department in colorado
yes sergeant what can i do for you
well we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town and the filofax says he moved from your area one martin jefferson
hm no we never had a any rich africanamericans named jefferson here if we had we would have framed him ourselves
well he doesn't really look that black
yeah i don't uh hold on a second there was one we framed a couple of times but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial
you say he disappeared what did you frame him for
we uhhh found some kids that had stayed over at his place and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges
molestation nice
yeah it was a lot of work took years but we were finally able to arrest him then we planted some evidence took embarassing photos of his penis and threw him in a dirty prison cell with doodie feces on the walls you should have seen him squirm
that's damn fine police work sergeant damn fine
heh yeah but the point is this guy didn't really look black either we had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a dna sample to be sure
jesus christ monkeyballs it must be the same guy
mr jefferson hello
come on blanket we gotta go before your dad sees us
what are you doing with my blanket  come on blanket play with me jeechabee durtah hee
haaaaa
go go ruuun
sutah
haaaaa
wuchatennah jamonah heehee
oh jesus
what the hell is going on you guys
my blanket let's play blanket
nonono wait i'm not blanket
wee he can fly he can fly
aaaah aaaah stop a
oh my god they killed kenny
you bastard
blanket blanket come play
nooo
come on
run blanket run
ah
dainduh dainduh dainduh
hang on blanket
dugh heehee ja
freeze jefferson the gig is up you are wanted for child molestation
no i am sick and tired of people harassing mr jefferson  all i've been hearing since mr jefferson moved here are sick lies that he molests children that he's a bad father that he has plastic surgery
it's ignorant
sure maybe mr jefferson's a little different but that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood what's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child
all right let's just say all the bad things said about mr jefferson are lies let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit  let's say it's all made up and mr jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood well that's fine except for that he has children now and when people have children they have to grow up
you're right i've been so obsessed with my childhood that i've forgotten about his i thought having lots of rides and toys was enough but blanket doesn't need a playmate he needs a father and a normal life chickuckoo gainuh  blanket i wanna give away all my money i i wanna get a normal job and take a shot at raising you in a normal setting
look everybody i'm a normal little boy
well if you're gonna give away all your money then i guess we can drop all those charges no point in putting another poor black man in jail
all right things just might work out
things can always work out as long as we know we have the power to changewe all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts'and we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdaysand you know it might be hard but all you've got to do is startand you can change all of your evil molesting waysjejabee durtah heehee ooooh jejabee durtah heehee jamonah butchatamonah chichcha
yes
hello ma'am we're going around town and offering snowshoveling service would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars

shoveling accident
oooh no come on inside  wait right here i'll be right back
you're so lucky i have a sore shoulder kyle or i would have let you have it
cartman just keep your mouth shut
this is breaking news here's anchorman aaron brown
incredible absolutely amazing news today a man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car
whoa
christina naylon has more
the news is incredible aaron experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now and have been able to learn that he is from the year  his condition is stable and speculation continues as to why he has come has he come to deliver a cure for cancer or to fix something wrong with the past
have to interrupt you there christina apparently brad morgan is inside the base with breaking news brad
aaron the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time looking for work uh he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time and so he built a time portal and has come back to st century america uh to find a job here
heheh it's absolutely astounding he came back here for work
huh that's right aaron hi his plan is to get a job here in our time so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account uh which will earn interest and by the year  be worth billions of dollars uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars but uh enough he says to feed his family
and now i understand we're going to harrison moore uh for an explanation on how the time portal works harrison
aaron i'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow terminator rules that is it's one way only and you can't go back this is in contrast say to back to the future rules where back and forth is possible and of course timerider rules which are just plain silly anyway it appears that the man from the future is here to stay
mom dad did you see they found a man from the future
we know stanley we've been watching
if you're just joining us a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a oneway time portal looking for work uh the president is expected to give an announcement at any time
breaking news here at the time portal aaron it appears that another person from the future has just arrived  it looks as if the job at wendy's did work for the original immigrant this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off and wishes the same for his family
there you go all set sweetie
mom can we go try to see the people from the future i have a bunch of questions i wanna ask 'em
i'm sure a lot of people do hon it's pretty exciting isn't it now you just get some sleep  you've had a busy day  goodnight sweetie
night mom  wow two people from the future how cool
yes
hello mrs landis would you like snowshoveling service again today
ooo oh dear i'm sorry boys but i've already hired someone else to do it
what who
one of those immigrants from the future he said he would do it for twentyfive cents
twentyfive cents well that's not even worth it
all right guys come on let's go to the next house
dude
son of a bitch
still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today some even bringing their entire families the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the timetravel process this is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about american life in the future chris holt joins us now chris
yes there are incredible things we're learning about americans in the future aaron i it appears that in the future americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races they are all one color which is a yellowy lightbrownish whitish color uh it seems race is no longer an issue in the future because all ethnicities have mixed into one perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language the people in the future speak a complete mix of english chinese turkish and indeed all world languages which sounds something like this  back to you aaron
apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work since they offer to work for such low wages they're being hired all over america
this is bullcrap i ain't standin' for this
all right folks my name is darryl weathers and i'm with the construction workers' union i work with a lot of fine men who have families to feed now i don't know about you all but we worked long and hard to get our pay up to a level where we could make a decent living and now these people from the future are showin' up and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin' they took our jobs
we're in the moving business fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere they took our jobs
they took your jobs
well what about us in the fastfood business the restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less they took our jobs
they took your jobs
it's affecting kids too me and my friends started our own snowshoveling business we were trying to be responsible and make money you know but then the people came along and and now we're out of work too  oh they took our jobs
they took yer jobs
stanley it's almost eight o'clock where have you been
i was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh
oh yes the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home could you please set the table for dinner
who is that
that's our new housekeeper mrs  gruhd she's gonna help around the house on tuesdays and thursdays  and she'll do it for ten cents an hour
oh but that's the problem those goobacks are taking our jobs
what
oh my god  stan marsh how dare you use that timebashing slur
who taught you to talk like that
well dude they are taking people's jobs away
they're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do
i wanted my job
hey stanley you need to understand something those people from the future have had a hard life where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor you can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from so for us who have everything sooo good to judge them is wrong do you understand next time you think about calling them goobacks you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is
that's right we're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist
timecist
you know a racist but against people from the
people from the future right got it
all right good now let's all go eat some of mrs gruhd's great future cooking
and now here is bill o' reilly
welcome welcome to the nospin zone all right and what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future all right now most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it all right but others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off all right now i've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter on my right is pissedoff whitetrash redneck conservative
thanks for having me bill
and on my left is aging hippie liberal douche
hello
now pissedoff redneck you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal all right
you're goddamned right these people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent presentday americans  they took our jobs
they took our jobs
those jobs belong to people from the present
all right what say you aging hippie liberal douche
heh it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem heh but really the problem is america it is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty your ancestors came to america as immigrants what right do you have to turn these people away
all right redneck your rebuttal
they took our jobs
they took our jobs
tookourderb
all right children the school board has mandated that i must now teach class in both presentday english and futurespeak
what
so with that in mind let's continue our lessons on verbs remember that there are transitive verbs such as  the boy threw the red ball which in futurespeak of course is  everyone say it with me  aaand there are intransitive verbs such as  the  bus from denver arrived twelve hours late or in futurespeak vvut
vvut
dude hold on this is bullcrap if they wanna live in our time then they should learn our language
yeah
that's right
hey now these immigrants have a right to retain their culture who are we to say our language is best they deserve to have an education just as much as you do
thank you aging hippie liberal douche
you betcha
timmih
okay now let's get back to it kids what kind of verb is this  the sad girl puts balls in her mouth or in futurespeak of course gluch gligh balls glych gligh
this is bullcrap
listen up everybody we've just received a reply from our congressman  dear intolerant rednecks we sympathize with you all losing your jobs however we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane
what that's ridiculous
they can't do that
that was a good idea
so it appears the government ain't gonna help us which means we gotta take matters into our own hands the only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening
hey that's right if there is no future then there'll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs
take rjurbs
all right so any ideas how we can stop the future from happening
how about we cause more global warming so that in the future the polar ice caps melt and it ushers in a new ice age
how the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age
well you know the global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'
chet you are a fuckin' retard you know that even if global warming were real which all proven scientific data shows it isn't it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen you think an ice age can just happen all of a suddenlike
well i was just tryin' to be helpful
well help yourself to a fuckin' science book 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard now come on people we've got to think damnit they took our jaorbs
they took our jobs
aw dude
gaur da'ka

chicken sandwich
no it's not a chicken sandwich  i want a goddamned cheeseburger and some goddamned fries you fucking goobacks
stan marsh
aw awwww
come on people think how are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs
hey i got an idea uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other
did you say get gay
hey yeah well that's not a bad idea
what gettin' gay
think about it these people are from the future right well if we can git everyone to turn queer then there won't be no children to have no children and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs
i ain't turnin' queer
you have to jimbo or else we won't be able to stop them they too 'r jaobs
yeah they took our jobs
took our jobs
let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear come on  come on you want your jobs back or not
all right you future bastards think you can take our jubs well we'll show you come'ere earl  how do you like that gooback  come on you guys  everyone who believes in america join in with us we're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent
aw come on dad how come i have to go to work with you
because you're being grounded stanley now i don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth  you just sit right there stanley and you thnk about what you've done
you'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh
hey mr nelson
oh r randy uh i'm surprised to see you here
why this is my office
ooohh boy didn't you get my phone message ooo this is awkward well the thing is randy you've been replaced
what
well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing uh this is mr glughgogawk
gheglo
you can't be serious
i'm sssorry randy it's just with all the budget cuts and all we'll give you some time to clean out your desk follow me mr glughgogawk i'll show you to the copy room
oh my god they took my jarb
they took yer jarb
this is cnn
breaking news at the time border we go now live to harrison moore
aaron i'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out  hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another  these men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention these unemployed men have been having sex for several days joining me is their spokesperson randy marsh  mr marsh what exactly are you trying to accomplish
we're doing the only thing we can do if our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come then we have to take matters into our own hands  we're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans presentday america number one
yeah america
take our jobs
do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity
all we can do is try harrison
trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness
young man what do you think about all this
i i think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us  they're just humans trying to make their lives better look it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time then it's just gonna make our time crappy too maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening but making the future better
huh
i mean maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future then then the future won't be so bad and these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work
hey he's right if we build for a better future the immigrants will stay there
yeah we've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow
well what are we waiting for
we've got to work for a better future we've got to join hands for tomorrowtake the first step and you will see the future begins with you and mewe can start to make a difference if we want it for our childrenrecycle that can and plant that tree 'cause the future begins with you and me
look it's working
the future begins with you and me
the immigrants are fadin' away
we're doing it
we've got to work for a better future we've got to join hands for tomorrowtake the first step and you will see the future
dude wait wait ho hold on wait a second  this is gay

hey south park do you have school spirit
moooooooo
i think us cows have the best school spirit huh mandy
yeah and south park is really gonna stick it to littleton next week
let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going
it's mooey mooey wave to me wave to me mooey
butters shut the hell up
we are people for the ethical treatment of animals we protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot
oh jesus not peta again
cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity
this is the fate of the cow this is your insensitivity
ewww
the cow is a slave the cow is a commodity to be thrown away by a society gone wrong
all right children i have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by ecoterrorists for the th time we are going to change our school mascot
awwwwwwww
but mr garrison if we change our mascot that means the ecoterrorists win
that's right stanley the ecoterrorists win  now i have here a mascot selection sheet every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most and the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot
but we like being the cows
you're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions
geget outta here peta we're changin' the mascot already
who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves
oh geget outta here  geget out  jesus where do they keep coming from  go on get outta here
this is bullcrap dude
now children it's not that bad there's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from the hurricanes the blizzards the redskins the indians
but aren't indians and redskins just as offensive
no those are fine peta doesn't care about people
goddammit vegans piss me off now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot
wait you guys i have an awesome idea we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet and instead write in giant douche
yeheah
yeah totally awesome
yeh no no wait wait i got a better idea you guys what we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet and instead write in turd sandwich
turd sandwich isn't better than giant douche
heh it's only about a thousand times better am i right guys come on we have to tell everybody fast this is gonna be so funny
it was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in giant douche it's way funnier
it is not
kenny what's funnier a giant douche or a turd sandwich
giant douche
aw you're just saying that because i broke your cat's leg last week
stan do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich
dude i really don't care
that's two against one 'cause stan doesn't care so it's giant douche
wait wait what about butters
huh
you hate butters
goddammit you guys butters is our friend and he's allowed to have his opinion butters which is funnier a stupid notfunny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich
hahaha a turd sandwich
you misled him fatass
it's the best choice and me and butters are sticking with it
yeah what's this for
jimmy we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny and you have to tell us which one would be funnier
that's a fantastic idea fellas uh the key to successful humor is sstaying power uh tell me the first mascot idea
a giant douche
heh huh okay that's pretty funny now what's the second
a turd sandwich
turhr ohokahay okay now let's wait ten seconds  okay now ttell me the first one again
giant douche
and the second
turd sandwich
gee ththey're both screamingly funny fellas better give it another ten seconds all right now we'll see which one really has staying power number one
a giant douche
okay i think that's it number
turd sandwich
gee i don't know what to say fellas they're both instant classics but i guess i'll have to go with giant douche simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless adding a parody slant to the satire
awwwww
ohhh we lost
all right it's decided let's all write in giant douche
okay you win kyle
attention students we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets and there will now be a schoolwide vote between the top two nominations so here is the first mostrequested candidate a giant douche

how was school today stanley
it was ridiculous we have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich
what did you say
did you just say that voting is ridiculous
no i think voting is great but if i have to choose between a douche and a turd i just don't see the point
you don't see the point oh you young people just make me sick
stanley do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote
mom ai just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd i di don't care
you don't care you really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot on your football helmets a turd
well hold on randy i think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms
you're crazy a da douche is at least clean
it's sexist is what it is
you don't understand the issues sharon
are you calling me ignorant
you think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich well you're not exactly einstein
i am sick of you belittling my opinion you son of a bitch
i hate this family i hate it
puff daddy
your friend kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting

hello clyde
what do you guys want
we were just wondering who you might be voting for for the school's new mascot
i haven't decided yet
oh really well that's interesting you certainly should think about it and make the right decision  butterscotch candy
sure
clyde are you aware of what turd sandwich can bring to our school
a turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot but even the first sandwich
you see what turd sandwich brings to our school clyde is a complete package the turd and the bread and the lettuce and the olives
whewhere as giant douche is just well jujust a jujujust a giant douche
so come voting day you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich yes
i'm still not totally sure
well then perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy
you're doing the right thing stan don't you feel like you're a part of something now
i guess
look it may not seem important now but your vote really does count and we all have to do our part
okay
woah wait what are you doing
i'm voting
no no you you wrote down turd sandwich
yeah i know
dude you're supposed to vote for giant douche
i thought i was supposed to make my own decision
well yeah but not if your decision is for turd sandwich what the hell is wrong with you
wait a minute you didn't want me to vote you wanted me to vote for your guy
well i just figured you'd vote for my guy who's fuckin' friend are you  puffy
hey fuck off kyle  don't let them intimidate you stan i'll help walk you to the booth and then i'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings
oh forget it i'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and i'm and i'm not gonna be threatened into voting if i don't feel comfortable with it i'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it
we've simply had it with your son mr and mrs marsh voting just doesn't appear to be important to him
stanley when you left for school this morning you said you were going to vote
the whole thing is a joke
you see he's out of control it's nearly torn our whole family apart
well my hands are tied we can no longer have stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children he must be removed
oh are you happy now stan you just got yourself suspended
no i'm afraid it's worse than that by county law i'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible
expulsion
no banishment
bbanibanishment
you can appeal to the city council but i don't think it'll do any good your son must leave south park never to return
oh randy
our son banished where did we go wrong
youyou're all joking right
as it was in the times of our forefathers so it is now stan marsh for not following our most sacred of rites you are hereby banished from south park for all eternity or until you decide that voting is important goodbye stan may the gods treat you more kindly than we did
stan don't you think this has gone far enough is it really that big a deal  yeah just vote for giant douche
i'm not voting
yo puffy man are we just gonna let this happen  we've gots to kill this nonvotin' fool
no justacious let him go he won't survive a forenight in the wilderness
this is breaking your mother's heart stan she couldn't even help tie you to the horse
dad isn't this a little extreme
jesus i guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is  goodbye son  that's one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do
look what is that
oh the poor thing
hello

i was put on the horse i didn't wanna ride it
i don't know if you can stay we'll have to ask dr cornwallis come  we don't normally allow outsiders see here we live in harmony with animals they're not our pets but our fellow living beings we work with the animals and try to live as they do  we make friends with the animals we coexist and we intermarry  this is my wife janice  the outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama but our love knows no boundaries
wow you guys really love animals
and why not mark here has been with kelly for three years now  and gary and sally here have just managed to have a child together
kill me
yes life here is good and natural but now that you know where our compound is you'll either have to live with us or be murdered
i'll live with you
it's not up to you you'll have to talk with dr cornwallis  what did he say
he said i can stay
excellent dr cornwallis is wise beyond his year here's your peta shirt and a bumper sticker
this is debate  with your host jim lehrer
welcome to the cableaccess televised debate between a giant douche  and a turd sandwich  we'll start with giant douche sir some students and parents are reluctant to have a giant douche represent them what do you say to those people
jim first of all i would like to thank you for monitoring this debate and i would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming
aww suckup suckup  what that's an obvious suckup move
but i would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent he is a turd sandwich
you're a turd sandwich
no sir if you'll pardon me you are in fact the turd sandwich
you're a turd sandwich
sir you are a turd sandwich
you're a turd sandwich
ahh turd sandwich i will ask you not to speak out of turn
ii'm sorry jim
anyway as i was saying ahh wait ii forgot what i was saying
ha what a douche
all right turd sandwich this next question is for you how should south park elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events
uh you know uh my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question if you ask him the same question he would not answer it  he would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzze
your time is up turd
stan i want to introduce you to my stepdaughter teresa  she seems to have taken a liking to you  and she's ovulating
ahh no thanks that's okay
stan some peta members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals
i do love animals just not like you guys do
you don't belong here stan you should return home
i can't i was banished for not voting
but why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote
i think voting is great i just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich
but stan don't you know it's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd they're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics
i guess i guess you're right
yo what did i say was going to happen to you bitch
aaah
aaaah he's wearing the skin of an animal  take that  i hope that teaches you a lesson about being hurt
itius rodicus
vote or die

oh no noooo
ha you lose fatass
uh hey wait a minute

can i help you
yeah we've come to complain we don't want a wallmart in our town
who does nobody likes what the wallmart does but it keeps right on doing it
we want to talk to who's in charge
in charge i guess that would be harvey brown he's the current president of wallmart one of the original creators
where's he
we invented the wallmart super center in  the idea was simple build a store for onestop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low  we didn't know what we were doing in just four years it was out of control
so how do we stop it
you don't stop it
there has to be a way
there's nothing don't you understand nothing can stop the wallmart in your town unless of course you can find and destroy its heart
the heart of wallmart
sir don't you think you're talking a little too much
every wallmart has a heart somewhere near the television department destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process
you speak too much sir
why don't you guys just destroy the heart
because the wallmart stops you many have tried kid union leaders nature activists even the best fairtrade lawyers tried to stop the wallmart and now they are wallmart shoppers all
all right come on you guys we have to get back home
it won't work don't you understand it isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but wallmart left jesus what did we do what did we do  boys  tell the world i'm sorry
no dude don't
that's ten bucks you owe me dickface
all right this is it if wallmart has a heart we have to find it and destroy it no matter what the wallmart does to try to stop us we have to be strong let's do it

to find the heart of wallmart one must first ask oneself who is it that asked the question

ah you know the answer but not the question
the question is where is the heart

thanks so much for coming to visit butters in the hospital boys it means a lot to him
what happened to him doctor
from the test results it would appear your child was tortured by a bully he received a massive snuggie his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him he also received two indian sunburns on his forearms a charlie horse on the thigh and a seconddegree titty twister and from the damage to his head area it appears he was also given a swirly a colossal one  it also looks like he received a noogie and a polish bike ride
what's that
we aren't sure we only know that there is no cure
if only we had let him in  why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help
now honey we were trying to read
we've got to tell them who did this you guys we're gonna get it as bad as butters
that's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out i've been lying for five years
maybe you didn't hear so good in there kyle seconddegree tittytwister

yeah i think that was one of our best shows yet
boys i'm afraid i have some bad news the school has to cancel your show
what
for god's sakewhy mr mmmeryl
well the students just aren't watching ya your rating was only a four this whole week
how many students is that
four  four students watch your show and meanwhile craig's show is getting a
craig's show
what is that butthole doing now
ohoh it's brilliant it's all just video footage of animals closeup with a wide angle lens
animals closeup with a wide angle lens
but that's that's crap that's not even tv
it's what the students want and it's cheaper to make than your show just one person and a video camera craig is a genius uhsorry kids
but mr meryl we're trying to bring the news to the students they need to know the facts and our news team delivers them very much
kids don't care about the news boys it's boring kids wanna see animals closeup with a wide angle lens
please mr meryl but the news is our life without it we have nothing
i'm sorry kids yyyou should be proud of what you've done it's just that it's kind of gay
you're gay
gee whiz we sure worked hard on that new show
apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work
hello boys ready to do some whistlin'
fuck off whistlin' willy we're not in the mood
if you want a pizza you've gotta whistle  come on  there you go
god i wish we had a pizza hut in south park
hey look craig just walked in
yeah
hey look it's craig
hey craig over here
geez all that from a stupid video show
oh hey guys heard about your news show being cancelled
go play with yourself craig
yeah well i've got an overall deal with the school heh they're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows
your idea took about this much thought craig
this much more than you had  hey a round of root beers for everyone on me
woohoo
kenny what the hell are you doing with this asshole
craig just asked me to do his show geez
you're helping craig make his show i can't believe you would betray us like that we've always been supercool to you hahahahahaaahaaa we're gonna do a news show and you can't do it with us because you are too poooor and poor people don't watch the newoos nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaaah whatever kenny
hey gang i brought the new episode of wide angle closeup animals
put it put it up on the monitors
cuuute  super cuuute
gah i just don't get it
wow those animals are pretty cute
token now come on guys we worked too hard to just roll over for craig and his stupid overall deal instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves we just need to figure out how to make our show better
yeah maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week they'll let us stay on the air
well what are we waitin' for
come on guys
all right we all need to come up with ideas for our show
how about we revamp the name super school news sounds dry
it should be sexy news
action news
yeah sexy action that's good
maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on
right we should make up stories because they'll be far more interesting
hey yeah uh why i could say i saw celebrities even though i didn't aaand then lie about what i saw them doing
nice butters write that down
lie about celebrities
we have to appeal to all the students so we we need hot girls for the sixth graders
and panda bears for the preschoolers
good
maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die
yeah we should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive
oh boy
fellas are you sure all of this ieehethical
we're in fourth grade jimmy we don't even know what ethical means
all right sexy action school news team it's time to go to work get out there and get some stories
sexy action school news team ho
ah token can i have a quick word with you  look token ii know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you but uh well the thing is token we we really need to revamp your whole tv persona
huh
you see token people really enjoy seeing africanamericans on the news seeing africanamericans on the news not hearing them that's why all africanamericans newspeople learn to talk more wha how should i say white  token all the great africanamericans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure caucasian dialect there's no shame in it and i think it'll really help our ratings
this is south park elementary school closedcircuit television and now  time with the sexy action school news
is south park about to explode from a methane gas leak more on that later but first stan marsh has a look at some new outfits for the raisins girls
woohoo woohoo
eric the outfits are even skimpier than before leaving very little to the imagination no doubt that if i were a little older i would be aroused
woowhoowoo

one testicle  what an asshole
uhoh looks like it's panda bear madness minute
oh yeah panda bear madness and now let's get a look at the celebrity watch with butters
this isn't the news this is a trtrtrtrtravesty

fellas fellas i got fanttastic news the vicepresident dick cheney was in denver yesterday and i got an interview with him for our news show
oooo interview with the vicepresident hmmm frankly jimmy i don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pieeating and who's got skidmarks monday
but this is real news
it's boring news jimmy
how do you know you you haven't sseen it yet
all right tell me about it
well in the interview mr cheney tells me all about how the
aww ohh god i just got so sleepy i'm sorry what were we talking about
look fellas i've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going we're dumbing down the school
no jimmy the school is already dumb we're just giving them what they want
we're making the news more appealing to students
this isn't the news this a bbbastardized quest for ratings damnit we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa the facts  don't you see what we've done in our efforts to compete with craig's smallminded show we've made a mockery of nnununews reporting i remember when we all made an oath to each other way back when started playing news reporter that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity well our integrity is jeopardized and if we can't report news the honest way what good is nnews reporting
boys first of all i want to tell you how impressed i am with your ability to get more ratings your show beat closeup animals with a wide angle lens by three viewers
all right woohoo awesome
i knew we could do it
we beat closeup animals
oh man this is so great we we worked so hard to be on top oh oh come'ere you
yes but unfortunately you got crushed in the ratings by craig's new show
craig's new show
all the students love it it's an incredible idea called closeup animals with a wide angle lens wearing hats take a look  that craig is a freakin' genius i tell ya he's like an idea machine
does does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled
i'm afraid it's worse than that boys i'm gonna have to give you all f's in extracurricular av class you have to learn now how important ratings are
hey whabbut we gave it our best
yes and i guess your best wasn't good enough
i don't believe it
i can't lose this extracurricular credit i need it to pass fourth grade
stupid news hair
fellas don't you see this proves my point we have to elevate our ideas up not down
yeah jimmy's right i know we can come up with way better ideas than craig
yeah to save our show all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever
what if we do a show where we  uh no
how about we have us um hmmm
come on doesn't anybody have any show ideas
well how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us
we did that
wow coming up with ideas is hard
look you guys if craig can do it we can do it come on  how about we do a show with us ughhh
thee uhhh what if the
wait i've got it  crab people
crab people
they're like half crab half people and they live below the ground
dude i think we can do a little better than crab people
i know we should read the funnies  i always get good ideas from the funnies
butters only gay little dweebs read the funnies
yeah i read 'em all the time uh here's one the uh snail tripped over a hurdle and the other snail says well that's gonna add another hour to his time  yeah you guys  heh
how about we do a show where we kill butters
so dagwood says good guhgood thing we're playin' uh the back nine at your house
we're hopelessly stuck completely out of ideas
we have crab people just sayin'
wait you know what we should do we should all take a bunch of cough medicine
cough medicine
that's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess they take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads
gee whiz there sure is a lot of 'em
how do we know which one to use
how about this one calminex  warning taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects
that sounds perfect
bbbingo
can i help you boys
uh yeah we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine
whoa boys that's not what you need to come up with ideas
it's not
no what you want is calminex pm  it has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses
oh okay
now if it's more of a lucid speedy kind of high you're looking for i do also carry the daytab cold and flu then there's the maximumstrength cortitussin cough and cold but of course that's only if you really want to trip balls
whawhat do you think fellas
i guess we'll just take all of 'em
that's the spirit all right boys i'll just need your parents' permission  kidding i'm just pulling your legs come on over to the register
oh looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight

this body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it
which can only mean one thing
ha you see
that a copycat killer is on the loose we need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away

we'll pay you up front this time we've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again
i'm afraid that my powers are not for sale and by that i mean they absolutely are for sale let's go
tom i'm standing in a meadow just outside of town where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer child wunderkind eric cartman is now arriving on the scene
this is fuckin' ridiculous

maybe his powers have left him
yeah
wait a minute  fried chicken it's tender and it's fresh  there's maple syrup maple syrup's being put on the chicken
what the hell is wrong with these people
they're never gonna catch the serial killer he's too smart do you want to see my cotton panties

if i'm happy and i know it clap my handsclap clapif i'm happy and i know it clap my handsclap clap
eric sweetie there's um some people here to see you
more people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts huh ahhh it's so very tiring
ah no these people claim that they are the real psychic detectives
so you are the little boy who's been taking all our work
oooh i'll go make some tea
kid we have a problem you didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did
yeah
proper channels
you were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the psychic detective school
i was given my gift from a tragic accident i didn't need to go to psychic detective school
well you just can't say you're a psychic detective you have to use the ad in the comic book
you must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings
ten percent my balls get lost
very well then you give us no choice roger
all right everyone
oh goodness what's going on
stand back mother we're having a telekinetic battle of minds
oooooh
enough  we are obviously quite evenly matched i guess this will have to be settled in court
in court
we brought a classaction lawsuit against you we'll see you before the judge tomorrow
is it over
her name is veronica crabtree bus driver for the elementary school she was considered an ancillary character one the fans wouldn't miss much
jesus christ cause of death
same mo sir multiple stab wounds left hand cut off and missing
so you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer jesus where will it end  every time i put a killer behind bars another guy just steps in and takes his place what am i doing wrong
excuse me sir i think i know who did this we saw this guy at the last crime scene and and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime well i followed this guy to his house and when he left again i collected some fingerprints and did a bloodsample analysis  i'm pretty sure he's your man
how do you know are you psychic
no
look kid don't waste my time with your bloodsampling fingerprinty hocuspocus i have to find this new killer now i owe it to that victim over there i know she hadn't been in any recent episodes but dammit she deserved better than this come on murph we've gotta talk to eric cartman again
why won't anybody listen to me
don't take it personally kyle
i am taking it personally because cartman is a retard just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a wait that's it if i want people to listen to me i just have to be as stupid as cartman
dude i really don't think that's a good idea
there has to be another way
be sure to take me to the same hospital
now kyle don't fly too close to the sun or it'll burn your wings an and you'll crash into the ocean
butters goddammit
all right here we go  since the days of copernicus man has dreamed of flight on this historic day we remem aw screw it
call an ambulance
multiple arrests were made today for the murder of hillary neals police raided the south park motel  at  am where seven psychic detectives were staying  the psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective eric cartman  who is now the only psychic not behind bars what an amazing coincidence
cool  ah kyle is at the door come in kyle  who are you
you you give everyone else credit for my work because you fail to see my greatness
'kay sweet
because of you nobody knows the extent of my deeds
oh yeah awesome hold on just a second  mom there's some homeless guy here make him go away
hey hey what's goin' on
you are obviously a big fan of my work
i don't even know you dude
but i am the serial killer the one whose rightful place in history you have smirched
oh jesus
and now you will have a place of honor as my nineteenth victim
no no you don't wanna kill me please i'll give you anything you want
before you die let me show you the things that i've done so you will understand the breadth of my transformation  this is me at the grand canyon  do you see this is me at mount rushmore  do you see
heheh
do you see
yes yes i see
here i am at the alamo in san antonio  this was just outside of the gift shop do you see
aaaaaaah
dammit dammit all to hell they just found another body that means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose where's my psychic
sorry sarge the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours
sir dr kels just called from the hospital he says another little boy just awoke from a coma and is having psychic visions
let's go
this is the young man here he was in a coma for over sixteen hours
doctor could you remove his face warmer we'd like to speak with him
of course nurse
young man the doctor said you've had some visions about our newest murder
i see a man with a baseball cap  he's killing now oh i'm seeing it all flash before my eyes the guy's name is michael deets and he lives at  castillo street he's usually there between seven and eleven pm
what do you think mitch
i don't know how do we know this kid is really psychic i mean this boy is certainly no eric cartman
all right we'll check this deets guy out but let's use that one thing that we never use
sir
you know what's that one thing that starts with an r that we never use
restraint
yeah yeah restraint we'll check this guy out but let's use some restraint
look look at the things i've done here i am at yellowstone national park  do you see here are pictures of my trip to cheyenne for frontier days do you see
oh god i'm so bored somebody help me
good evening sir we're park county detectives we were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house misterrr
god
well mr god it won't take but a second it might help us with an investigation
hey come over here
i see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women my son is a big fan of that too
sarge in here
jesus h that boy was right arrest that guy  whoawhoawaitwaitheywaitwaityo oh wait a minute no ah i'm wrong
sir
this isn't the guy the serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands
right
well those aren't left hands  see on your left hand the thumb faces to the left those are all right hands
ohhh
nope this isn't our man  we're sorry mr god it appears we've wasted your time
hey help
heh pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall heh no wonder that boy thought he was a killer
yeah amazing coincidence
heh sir
call it police intuition but somethin' in there just didn't feel right  wait a minute
sarge  what is it
i'm not sure i'm gonna have to run some tests
murphy do you remember what i was supposed to be doing
oh uhhh oh something about hands sir uh for the serial killer
oh right the hands right
oh my god murphy  you're not gonna believe this
that's it no more pictures  time to die
no please i'm sorry i gave other people credit for your killings ahah it was it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested
your hand will be one with the others
please just let me go ah i'm gonna tell everyone i'm not really psychic i've learned my lesson please i don't wanna  i don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you
hold it right there killer
you got here just in time he was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability
well young man you did an amazing thing not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer but a lot of innocent people are out of jail
yes thank you very much kyle
yes thanks
you're certainly a better psychic then eric
no don't you see cartman never had psychic visions and neither do these people the plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic there's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard
do you think that's true
it must be true the kid is psychic  but i don't suppose it really matters much because in the end the way i caught the killer was with good oldfashioned police work come on murphy
well young man i guess that just leaves one score to settle
you can't hurt me
then let this be our final battle
just stop it  stoop iiit  there's a logical explanation for that
way up in the mountains in a small little townthe main street was being decorated all up and downpeople stood in long lines sometimes waiting hours or morebecause christmas needs to be bought in a storebut out in the forest not too far away
the little woodland critters were also preparing for their christmas day
it's almost time when the time is herethe time that's only once a yearwe can hardly wait 'cause it's so neara woodland critter christmas
the little critters worked hard as they happily sangand each one of them had a quite interesting namethere was squirrely the squirrel rabbity the rabbitbeavery the beaver and beary the bearporcupiney the porcupine skunky the skunkfoxy the fox and deery the deerwoodpeckery the woodpecker mousey the mouseand chickadeey the chickadee all made the forest their houseand on that magical day stumbling upon all of thatwas a surprised little boy in a red poofball hat
what the hell
christmastime is once a yearevery critter holds it dearevery animal big or smallchristmas means so much to us all
well hello there welcome to our forest
how do you like our christmas tree
it's nice
why it's the most perfect tree in the forest
oh no i see a problem
what is it mousey
our christmas tree doesn't have a star
awww
we can't have a tree with no star on it
what are we gonna do
now don't be down y'all maybe our new friend can help us find a star
can you really oh would you please could you help us
okay okay
yay
and so using some paper and working with gleethe boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree
ohhhh
it's the nicest star i ever saw
the little critters cheered and beavery said with a smile
how would you like to sing and dance with us for a while
the boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said
uh no thanks i'm gonna go home
goo goodbye stanny
goodbye stanny bye cya i'll buy your hat
woof
hi stanny
oh whatta
his friends were all there what a wonderful surprisethe little boy smiled with joy in his eyes
what time is it
you aren't gonna believe what happened stanny it's the most magical christmas gift ever
porcupiney is pregnant
you guys i have to go to school tomorrow
i deduce the manboy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization
porcupiney is a virgin stanny her conception was immaculate
she's gonna give birth to our lord and savior
what
it has been foretold unto me that i would give birth on christmas day
so soon
how delightful
our souls are saved
finally the critters are gonna have a savior of their very own of their very own
there's just one problem we don't have a manger for our savior to be born in
awwww
but we got to have a manger
can you do it stan can you build us a manger huh
cheers
of course i'll build you a little manger the little boy criedand he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side
and out in the woods the boy steamed right aheadmaking a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head
gee whiz if it isn't the nicest manger i ever saw
i deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place for the son of our lord
does this mean we can go to sleep now
my son will have the nicest bed in all the forest
fit for a king
this is going to be the best critter christmas ever
it's almost time when the time is herethe time that's only once a yearwe can hardly wait 'cause it's so near
all right i'm going now
the mountain lion hide
go away shoo
is it gone
i deduce it is
i'm not cccomin' out
well this is the end the mountain lion obviously knows porcupiney is pregnant and he's gonna kill it again
again
every christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the son of our lord
oh dear i'm so very afraid
let's face it the mountain lion will never let our savior be born
awwww
hey we shouldn't be upset this christmas we've got stanny
of course stanny can do anything if he can build a manger he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion
christmas is saved
high up in the forest on a dark craggy peakthe horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weakfor the critters to be saved someone had to stop that nasty old cat
goddammit this is fucking ridiculous
said the little boy in the red poofball hat
killing a mountain lion was no easy taskbut he thought of a plan and he thought of it fast
grrr grrr come on out  come on critter killer your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over rawrrrrr  rawrrrrr
in a flash it was over a victorious blowthe mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below
okay there
mommy mommy  w wake up mommy wake up
don't leave us mommy  manboy why why did you kill our mommy why
i the critters their birbirth of a savior
the tiny cubs all gathered together and criedall alone in the world because their mother had died
aw awww
oooo
you all right lady porcupiney
oh yes just felt a little kick is all
well it's been much too long now uh i'm afraid our helpful friend stanny must be very dead
yep the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole
i guess that means our savior is gonna be made into savior stew
awwww
wait a minute look
stanny
stanny you're alive
but does that mean you killed the mountain lion
it's dead
for real and for true
are you sure
i'm sure it won't be hurting you anymore
he did it now our critter christmas can finally happen hail satan
hail satan
wait whawhat
you've done us a huge favor stanny without the mountain lion around the lady porcupiney can give birth to the antichrist
yaaay
waiwait the antichrist you said she was giving birth to your savior
yeah to the son of our lord satan prince of darkness
but i thought you meant the son of god
well think about it you really think god would have sex with a porcupine
no way only satan prince of darkness and king of all evil would do that yay
this just calls for a celebration let's sacrifice rabbity and eat his flesh
yay sacrifice me to the devil
drink his blood drink his blood
blood orgy
yay blood orgy blood orgy yay
what special time and special dayit's woodland critter christmas
hail satan
in the gentle forest clearing on christmas eve mornthe little forest critters prepared for the antichrist to be bornthe noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years pastbut now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassedand meanwhile three lion cubs were crying awayfor them there would certainly be no christmas dayand soon the forest would suffer from the offspring satan begatall of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat
ugh
now that he'd killed the noble lion queenthere was nobody to stop the apocalypse it seemed
uuugh
i know he said with a new happy grini'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again
no nonono
he ran out the living room turned out the lightand went back to the forest to set everything rightbut his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee he thought he could hide from his problems  not truehe knew in his heart the thing he had to do
leave me alone
he knew that only by going to the forest could he
all right all right all right god
hey look everyone it's our old pal stanny
oh boy stanny you came just in time
yeah we've got a big problem
the great satan has commanded that when the antichrist is born we must find a human host body to transfer it into
that way he could take over the whole world the whole world
the human must be nonbaptized and heathenistic against christ
we figured you'd be perfect
yay
i'm not a heathen i was baptized and my family's christian
awwwww
but we got to have a human host body for the antichrist
oh dear maybe we won't have a critter cchristmas after all
now don't be down y'all stanny can help us find nonbaptized heathen human
will you really stanny
no i'm not doing you anymore favors and i'm not letting you give birth to the antichrist  i came here to put a stop to all this
to stop us
but gee whiz stan if you try to stop us we'd have to use our evil satanic powers on ya
right whatever  i'm taking down the manger i built  ah  aaaah  aagh aaaahh  aaaaaaah aaaaaaah
oh boy our satanic powers sure did the trick
our powers get stronger every day get stronger every day
sorry stanny but you see nothing can stop the birth of the antichrist except for a mountain lion
and you got rid o'her
yay
the boy shook with anger he broke a sweat and fell illthen he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill
oh yeah
hello anybody in there
oh no it's the manboy who killed mommy
he's come to kill us now
it's okay i died inside when mommy was killed anyways
yeah better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around
look i'm sorry i killed your mom the the squirrel told me she was evil
you got tricked by a squirrel gee you're not too smart are you mister
i'm trying to make this all right again but the only thing that can stop devilworshiping critters is a mountain lion
yeah and you killed her
well you're mountain lions
us no we're just kids we still have our baby teeth
and our baby claws
and a dead mom
there still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby
what you mean like in an abortion
yeah an abortion that can work
but we don't know how to give abortions
do you know some place we can learn mister
where can they learn that the boy said with a frowni know the abortion clinic just outside of town
what
so he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormedand took them to where abortions are performed
no he didn't
yes he did
no he didn't
yes he did
no he didn't
yes he  did
oh goddammit
said the boy in the red poofball hat we've made it already little cubs fancy that
excuse me what are you doing here
the abortion doctor inquired
if you wanna be in the or a pass is required
i don't know i i'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something i i know it's ridiculous
well you're in luck i'm happy to informit's only three days until christmas so i have lots of abortions to performgather around my table cute little lionsi'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'
and so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair baseand all day watched abortion after abortion take place
christmas time is once a yearevery critter holds it dearevery animal big or smallchristmas means so much to us allit's once a year it's christmastimeand it happens once a yearit's once a year it's christmastimewhen we hear about how christmas only comesonce a year
this better have a point dude this really better have a point
it's almost time when the time is herethe time that's only once a year
oh look that little feller is all alone
gee he looks sad
hi there
what the hell
how come you're all alone on christmas eve
my family doesn't celebrate christmas
aww but why
well because we don't really believe in jesus
yay
but does that mean you aren't baptized
no i'm jewish
yay yay
you've got to come with us
you're perfect just puperfect
huh
yay woohoo woohoohoo
what special time and special dayit's woodland critter christmas
hail satan
'twas the night before christmas and above the woods way up higha new bright shiny star hung in the skyfor the world to be saved there was only one shota little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot
okay come on the critters are over this way you mountain lions ready to stop the antichrist from being born
sure we know how to give abortions now
he arrived at the critter forest ready to fightbut then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight
gosh we did it
the critter antichrist is born bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest
the antichrist had been born sealing the world's fatethe boy in the red poofball hat was too late
too late the hell is that

mr garrison could you do something please
sorry eric but if kyle feels discriminated against you'll have to stop or else i'll get a call from his mother
all right fine forget it
well but but what happened

i'm sorry but it's too late kyle santa's gonna have to kill you
no santa don't
we don't have a choice in a few hours the dark creature inside him will consume his soul
the little boy fretted he almost started to bawlbut that's when he came up with the best idea of all
the lion cubs
the little boy quickly begun
i took them to see how abortions are done
what
now cubs do like they showed you hurry up fastget the antichrist out of my friend kyle's ass
and in the twinkling starlight each little cub did their portionthey remembered all they had learned and gave kyle an abortion

line
hello mr garrison i'm dr biber i'll be performing your surgery today
god bless you doctor i know you'll make me well again
now you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty
my whole life i've been a woman trapped in a man's body a sexchange operation is my last chance at happiness
all right then let's begin  just relax mr garrison i think if more people could just see a sexchange operation they would know how perfectly natural it is the first thing i'm going to do is slice your balls
ough ergh eww
with the scrotum open i can now discard of your testicles
so long balls
now i'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis
oh that stings
now i'll just turn your penis inside out
oh oh jeez
all we need to do now is stuff the unskinned penis inside your pelvis and now i'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips
do i look like a woman
pretty much
dude don't be nervous
how can i not be nervous trying out for the allstate team has been my dream for years
you're the best player at our school dude you'll make the team for sure
this is ridiculous jews can't play basketball
i beat out your fat ass cartman
all students trying out for the allstate team to center court
good luck
all right boys now you're all here because you're the best of the best  i know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far so let's get out there and  show me what you've got  uh uh excuse me brofbroflovski is it
yeah
can we talk to you for a minute  you uh you're the best player in your school are ya
yep i love basketball i wanna play for the denver nuggets one day
yeah uh look kid you've got great skills and a great attitude but you're just not physically built for the game
oo whataya mean
well it's just that jew's can't play basketball  awright kids we've gotta work on that shooting come on
dude you were awesome kyle  look yyou gave it your best shot right that's all you could do
nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa youhoohoohoo lohost hahahahahaaahaaa  kyle i'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time
i know i deserve it
yeah you know why because jews can't play basketball
you're right  jesus that was fun
hey everybody you're not gonna believe it
believe what
it's mr garrison only it isn't mr garrison he he's a woman now
hello everybody  can you believe it ladies i'm one of you now  wow just look at all these tampons regular heavy flow oh boy i can't wait till i get my first period
hi gals  oh boy can you believe the sales they're havin' out there well i'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time  give us a hug girls' club  oh wow this is great look at that i'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman  sany any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together  you guys try those new wings tampons do those work well
kyle you have to cheer up dude so you aren't built right for basketball
but i feel like a basketball player that's all i wanna do
hello boys it's me your teacher mrs garrison
you guys mr garrison has titties
i had a sexchamge operation my penis is now a vagina and i'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life see ya in class
mom dad what's a sexchange operation
what th'um nuhnothing i i'll explain it to you when you're a little older
but our teacher mr garrison he just had his penis made into a vagina how come
penis
your teacher had a sex change oh my god
vagina
that does it i'm taking you boys out of that school
gerald that is very closedminded of you you shouldn't judge people who want to change
he's a teacher how are we supposed to explain this to our children
it's very simple  you see kyle sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside
yeah that's right
they feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body and so they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as do you understand
totally i totally understand
there you see gerald he totally understands
so i hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery
yeah my school teacher wanted to be a woman and you made him into one
oh yes mr garrison uh yes he had a vaginoplasty mhm
well do you also do other surgeries like that
sure you see sometimes a woman wants to be a man that procedure is called a peniplasty
no no uh i wanna be tall and black
you what
i hate being small and jewish i feel like a tall black man
ohhhhh you want a negroplasty
yeah
whaaa negroplasty
it's a fairly common procedure really just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like michael jackson had let's take a look here  what we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pigment producing cells inside  we break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer  now the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement  and we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia  negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars
uh excuse me is this really a good idea
well it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black otherwise i wouldn't recommend it
hello mr slave  boy have i been busy a woman's work is never done  i got some tampons i should be getting my period really soon i hope i don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my pms  mr slave i gotmrssomethin' for us too  would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed
no thanks
nu no thanks come on mr slave i wanna try out my new snootch
i can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what i thought
well i assumed you supported me it's still me i just have a vagina instead of a penis
but i'm gay i don't like vaginas
don't you even care that i was suffering i wasn't happy the way i was
it's great that you feel better but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel
look we can still be together all you have to do is stop being gay
how can you say that you're gay too
i'm not gay i'm a woman
oh jesus christ
oh so is that it  you're just gonna walk out you men are all alike go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina you fag
mom dad i have awesome news the doctor who gave mr garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black
what
dr biber said he can give me a negroplasty so i can finally look the way i've always wanted he even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what i would look like after the surgery
oh just great you see sheila this is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you now your son wants to be transracial
can i have three thousand dollars mom and dad huh can i
absolutely not kyle
but why not you said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves
yes but kyle
well all my life i felt i was black i've listened to hiphop i watch upn and i love playing basketball my body doesn't reflect who i am inside
kyle you have to accept your body the way it is
why why do i have to accept it when i can change it
the answer is no kyle you're not going to have negroplasty
but jews can't play basketball
kyle you'd better stop being antisemitic right now mister
i'm never speaking to either of you ever again
oh that does it
where are you going
that dr biber is about to get his ass bitten off
who the hell do you think you are
dr biber
what kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall africanamerican
oh you're kyle's father
huh that's right and i also happen to be a lawyer and i'm gonna have you sued for malpractice and your clinic shut down
what is that on your shirt
what th look they're they're dolphins why
ahhh you like dolphins hm
a buh i love dolphins ever since i was a child i dreamt of huh bbb but that has hardly any bearing on what i'm hear to
i can make you one
what
invert the back move the esophagus to the top of the head yes a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply
make me a dolphin
if i could swim with the dolphins the soft and gentle dolphinswhy can't i swim with the dolphins
no  no no it's crazy
there's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on ths inside
it's girls gone wild  these girls will do anything
oh jeez should i do it should i do it oh what the hell  wooo huhuh wooo
awww
look i'll giggle and make them bounce up and down  heeheeheeheehee heeheeheeheeheeheehee
oh boy men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits won't they men are all the same my boyfriend walked out on me turns out he was a fag but i've been livin' it up ever since havin' sex with all kinds of different guys girl power  you know the strange thing is i haven't gotten my period yet is there a reason a woman might miss her period
well normally if a woman misses her period it means she's pregnant
pregnant  oh my god of course  i haven't gotten to experience a period because one of those truckers i slept with got me knocked up  i'm pregnant everybody hoh boy now i can have an abortion
gerald what happened to you
that doctor is a miracle worker sheila iiii'm the happiest i've ever been  look ike you're daddy's a dolphin
a dolphin
sheila ihit was wrong of us to be so judgmental of kyle if he isn't happy with who he is then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself
gerald this is crazy
i used to think i was crazy but dr biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies all i did is change my appearance to look the way i felt  here and i'm telling you now that if we don't let kyle do the same he may never be happy ever we owe him more than that sheila we owe him understanding
fellas hey fellas you gotta come see
what
uhh it's kyle huh he's a negro
wow
can't believe it
did it hurt

mmister garrison
mrs garrison
mmrs garrison you can't have an abortion
don't you tell me what i can and can't do with my body  a woman has a right to choose
no i mean you're physically unable to have an abortion because you can't get pregnant
but i missed my period
you can't have periods either  you had a sex change mr garrison but you don't have ovaries or a womb you don't produce eggs
you mean i'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out
nthat's right
but i paid five thousand dollars to be a woman this would mean i i'm not really a woman ih i'm just a a i'm just a guy with a mutilated penis
basically yes
oh boy do i feel like a jackass
hey asshole
excuse me i'm performing an operation here
you told me you were going to make me into a woman
i gave you a sex change
yeah well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month you made me into a freak is what you did and i want you to change me back
am i a man yet
mr garrison i can't reattach your organs

oh you you're comin' with me right now to find my ball and scrotum right now mr man

sounds like an open and shut case all right let's head 'em out
i'm sorry kyle i should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only
so does this mean i'm not really a dolphin
let's get you two up to the clinic and i'll change you back for a nominal fee
but what about mr garrison he can't go back
you know what i'm okay even though i'm not truly a woman i think i still like the new me i'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag  hey guys this girl is staying a woman who wants to pound my vadge girl power
hello ma'am i'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites do you mind if i take a quick look around your house i'm afraid you may have hippies

sign sign everywhere signdone something to my mind
stan sweetie we're gonna go to the mall do you wanna come
mom the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude i've got some stuff you should read
okay sweetie
all right people we can move onto issue number b
mayor we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads
we don't have it in the budget to fix them right now
we'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands
we
you can't go in there
please i have to talk to you all right now
kid we're have a city council meeting
mayor something very big is happening and if you all don't give me a moment of your time there may be no more south park to council over
what are you talking about
i'm talking about the end of all life as we know it  for the past several days i've been noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town  at first i thought maybe it was just a coincidence  then i saw this  three new drum circles have sprouted up here here and here they're all growing in diameter at a rate of two hippies per hour what this means is that the hippies are conglomerating they're thriving if you will i think that they're setting up for a  hippie music festival
a what
it's it's simple science look when hippies start to nest in a new area it draws other hippies in with the right weather conditions and topography it can lead to a music festival one that last for days even weeks reggae on the river woodstock burning man they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now in my professional opinion i think we're looking at a fullblown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen
kid what the hell are you talking about
i know hippies i've hated them all my life i've kept this town free of hippies on my own since i was five and a half but i can't contain them on my own anymore we have to do something fast
uh eric we're we're talkin' about potholes right now m'kay
it's not potholes you need to worry about it's potheads i know what these people are capable of '
johnson get him out of here
what are you doing  you have to listen to me you can't sweep this problem under the rug  the town is in serious danger
you see the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind
right so how do we get back at them
yeah we're pissed off
well so my idea was this let's have like a week long music festival draw everyone here and then together we can tear it all down  whoa what the hell
i knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival all right everyone pack up your crap we're going to our basement
cartman what the hell are you doing
oh jesus not you guys  what happened were you bit did you eat their brownies did you eat their brownies
no
listen you're my friends but if you've been compromised i'll have no problem taking you out i'll expect the same from you
what is your problem get lost little eichmann
oh my god
what the hell are you doing
everybody get in a singlefile line
there you are
ah officer barbrady you're just in time these college knowitall hippies were setting up for a music festival just as i predicted
eric cartman you are under arrest
what
i was just over at your house and freed sixtythree people you had locked in your basement
you let them out jesus we have to find them
oh no you're coming downtown
no no we have to stop them you know how we we gotta stop them hebbiaaay
who was that
what did i do
you can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement
they're not people they're hippies
is this problem under control
i handled it mayor gee whiz
mayor mayor i confirmed the data the hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert
i know i signed the permit
you you what
i signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here their little festival should pump some money into our economy
they're hippies they don't have any money does the city council know about this
they don't have to know i can sign whatever permit i want
you just sold out our town
that kid really needs some psychiatric help
yeah
all right let's go
how much money is enough mayor how many people's lives it is all worth god damned hippy
this is a south park news special report
thousands of people have descended on south park for a hippie music jam festival the event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man
all right welcome to hippie jam fest   sooo great to see sooo many people turn out to make an impact on on the world
yeah
you said it
for too long the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources it is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place and we're gonna start right now
oh man i can't wait to see the look on those little eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove
sharon have have you seen stan
he went with his friends to that music festival
oh jesus what has gotten into that kid
now randy we were the same way once too don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the 's
yeah but when we did it we actually stood for something i mean remember woodstock sharon we actually did something there
you ate too much acid man
oh my god our son is with those people
sstan staaan
this is south park news
fear and horror in south park today as the music festival continues to grow  they're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight
tom the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams we don't know where this music festival came from but it's very close to consuming us all
steven what do we do
stan stan i need to get through please
randy randy you've got to get out of here if they just trample this park we'll be trapped it's too dangerous
my son is in there duhuh  stan  stan stan
hey chill man it's all good
have some water laced with acid
staogh ugh
what have i done
yeah south park is now the hippie capital of the world
uh huh hi eric uh how's it goin'
great i love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it
eric you were right about the hippies could you get rid of them for us now
let me guess they've started a hippie jam band music festival
we we need to take care of them eric they're out of control
forget it
please some of our kids are in there we should have listened to you earlier
yeah we apologize
please don't let them ruin our town
it's too late even if i did agree to help there's too many of them now
we know you can do it eric you're smart wha why you're the smartest kid in school m'kay
we're just asking you to try the whole town even got together and and baked you a cake
don't think that you can buy me with presents unless of course it's the new tonka radiocontrolled play bulldozer
it's yours
i want the batteries for it too and i get to drive it around in the school parking lot
fine
anything else
yes  kyle doesn't get to have one ever and he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get superjealous
well we can promise not to buy one for kyle but we we can't make him watch you play th  oh yes fine we'll force kyle to watch you
all right fine but now listen up and listen good i've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before so i'm gonna need every resource this town has and even if i don't succeed and it's a milliontoone shot that i will i still get the tonka radiocontrolled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where kyle has to watch me and get superjealous because he doesn't have one are we clear
wow this band is so crunchy dude i need more weed
so it seems like we have enough people now when do we start taking down the corporations
yeah man the corporations right now they're raping the world for money
yeah so where are they let's go get 'em
right now we're proving we don't need corporations we don't need money this can become a commune where everyone just helps each other
yeah we'll have one guy who like who like makes bread aand one guy who like llooks out for other people's safety
you mean like a baker and a cop
no no can't you imagine a place where people live together and like provide services for each other in exchange for their services
yeah it's called a town
you kids just haven't been to college yet but just you wait this thing is about to get huge
all right everyone listen up the hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick
my god
in less than three days all of south park will be completely consumed my only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd and reach the heart here  if we can reach the stage we can upload this slayer cd into their music system  hippies can't stand death metal if everything works they should disperse just before they consume us all
nice plan kid except there's one giant flaw that hippie crowd is massive how the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage
we drill  i've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd they pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside
yuh actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob it's a suicide mission
not just somebody i need a complete team to operate this vehicle along with me i'm gonna need a scientist an engineer and of course a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong
i'm the only scientist in town
i'm your engineer
honey no
i have to do it steven
all right then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong  lessee anyone would do anyone who meets the qualifications let's see  oh i know how about
yeah yeah i get it fine
i i can't believe we're actually listening to this this is a crazy plan
you got a better ides steven dammit my son is in there
there's no more time for ideas we have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days look it's a long shot but it's also the only shot we  got
tom i'm standing in south park colorado where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway some call it a suicide mission but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival
well i guess this is it sharon
please save our boy randy
butters if anything happens to mommy i i want you to be a good boy
ah i will mom
now now don't cry ladies everything's gonna be fine
i don't want you to worry about me clyde frog  hey you're the best stuffed animal i've ever had
look out for yourselves
godspeed

jesus they're dead in the water  '
uh excuse me excuse me can i have your attention please what are we doing  it's been nine days doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something
we're using the power of rock and roll to change the world woo
maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish we should look at ourselves i mean is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long
he's right it's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing
come on come on

probably
so why shouldn't we get some of that money we can be token's agents that way we get ten percent of whatever he makes
hey yeah we deserve that money just as much as he does
we just need a really kickass office and some nice suits a and a fountain in our lobby all top agencies have fountains in their lobbies we gotta make token think he needs us when actually he doesn't need us at all
he's looking at the sign
perfect all right you guys get back to the office i'll bring token there
all right
wait a minute you guys this is very important when i bring token back to the office have kenny hide in another room and call the phone on my desk

yeah
wing doesn't belong to us or to you we're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities
perhaps you're right we spend all this time mooching off the hopes and dreams of others forgetting that they are human beings
yeah it's not a very satisfying feeling
i am tired of this business it is a very dirty and perverse business
it's a lousy business i quit
me too
aw aw guys come on

open the gate
open the gate
welcome to the kingdom of heaven kenny i am peter
what the fuck is going on
there isn't much time kenny you're dead but your death was no accident heaven needs you
me
come there is much to discuss  things are not good in heaven kenny satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him god has changed the rules here for ages only mormons were allowed into heaven  but knowing that hell was becoming much larger god decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well an army that you must command
that i what
the sony psp was built by god to determine who on earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of satan you are the best you are the only hope for the universe
satan's army grows as we speak the dark lord knows that our armies are few in number and unorganized so our only hope is perfect strategy
a child this is god's solution
he beat satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations
archangel michael what say you
the child did something none of us could reach level sixty on the psp now i don't know if that's luck or perseverance but it's goddamned impressive all right kenny let me show you what we're up against  this is the kingdom of heaven satan's armies will attack the gate here they are ten billion in number maybe more  our armies are here here and here just under ten thousand strong  we are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole dark empire down basically kenny you are keanu reeves
my fellow damned souls now is the time for our assault  you know no fear you will drink the blood of angels we go now nothing can stop us
step aside step aside i say  satan god has mocked thee once again
my spy
god has found a way to defeat your army
impossible how
a young man basically hehe's like keanu reeves
oh jesus christ
my lord my lord we must attack now
what's the point they have a keanu reeves now
do not fear my lord your army is great
very well  demon army begin your march on heaven
up here you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress it is from here kenny that you shall command the armies of heaven
all right how am i supposed to do that
simple you will use this
this golden psp is king of all psps
hail the holy psp
it works just like the ones we sent to earth all the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield all you have to do is play the game kenny only this time it's for reals
gabriel returns with news
hell's army is departing they head now for the gates of heaven
prepare the troops  we must be ready for them  the time is at hand kenny the stage is set and the final battle between heaven and hell is about to begin the fate of the outcome is in your hands  where'd he go
doctor doctor we have a pulse
then that's it we brought him back
amazing doctor you've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day
call the parents they're going to be shocked to find out their son is alive
it's the latest in electroplastilical science your son's organs are all functioning again
it's a miracle kenny you're alive
i'm afraid he can't respond to you you see being dead for that long most of kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen your son is alive but in what we call a persistent vegetative state
will he ever recover
i'm afraid no brain cells cannot be repaired once dead but his soul is still in here  almost trapped in here if you will kenny is the same as he ever was it's just that now he's more like a tomato
he can't more on his ownah how will he eat
a feeding tube it pumps a nutrient paste directly into kenny's stomach with it we can actually keep kenny the tomato alive for years
a feeding tube
yes apparently they're using machines to keep them alive
but that's not natural god intended kenny to die what are these people doing
the child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body we have no one to command the troops with the psp
and satan's armies are approaching
oh goddammit
boys i want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice
are we in trouble or something
no boys i'm a lawyer your friend kenny has passed away and i've called you here to read his will
kenny had a will
in the highly likely event of my death i kenny mccormick wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends stan and kyle dudes you were the friends a guy could have
oh wow
that's really touching
looking bored fags
to eric cartman eric i never really liked you but then nobody does you have no ability to feel and you are going to die alone and miserable it is only because i feel so sorry for you that i leave you my sony psp
oh yeah oh yeah baby who the man who the man
there is one more thing i would like to ask you all as my friends if i should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on lifesupport please
please what
i don't know i lost the last page
who cares kenny's dead  when do i take possession of my psp sir
it's right here along with kenny's other belongings they're all yours
yes
he's alive
what
kenny mccormick he's alive at the hospital
oh my god
your army nears the kingdom of heaven my lord
i don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this keanu reeves god has
satan i come bearing good news the keanu reeves boy has been revived on earth his soul is no longer in heaven
then god is helpless  full march to the gates of heaven victory is ours
kenny
kenny you're alive
dude how'd you do that
he can't respond to you boys being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain
well well then he's not alive
he's alive heee smiles when i talk to him i think
that's not kenny kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire here look  kenny kenny look want a dollar
ii don't know if it's right to keep kenny alive on that machine ii just i don't know what he would want
yeah the lawyer lost that page
oh i just remembered kenny told me this one time that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube
he did when
um it was um this one time
he did not say that you just want him dead so you can have his stupid psp
stupid psp is stupid  did you all hear that  uh i mean i mean this isn't about psp kyle this is about my friend and his wishes and kenny said he didn't want to live like this
he did not
did so
did not
fine we'll see about this you freakin' jew  i'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if i have to go all the way to the supreme court
satan's army has crossed over the plains of limbo
then they will be here on the morrow without kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy psp
no there is another a japanese boy did make it to level fiftynine
are you stupid uriel japanese people don't have souls
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah uriel
oh right right i'm sorry
kenny remains our only hope here is what we must do  gabriel and uriel you go down to earth and try to get that feeding tube removed in the meantime  we will put all our troops at heaven's gate we will try to keep hell's army from breaking through as long as possible  hopefully it will be long enough to get our keanu reeves back
you see your honor i was the only one that kenny mccormick told his wishes to and kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine what they're doing to him is not right
well i'm sorry young man but the parents want their child kept alive i don't believe you have any legal authority here
i do have legal authority your honor you see i was kenny's bff
best friends forever
that's right kenny and i have been bffs since first grade here look  kenny has the other half of this bff necklace i believe you all know what that means and how serious this is
look kenny your friends are here to visit you again
but this just doesn't seem right
wha what's the matter doctor
i'm afraid i've been given a court order to remove kenny's feeding tube
what
he's right in here
cartman
kenny's bff says that kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially the courts have determined we must obey his wish
cartman is not kenny's bff
sir take a look at this
that's all the verification we need pull the feeding tube doctor
no doctor you can't
i'm sorry i have no choice
here is the hospital
this is hopeless gabriel we cannot interact with anything on earth how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed
that dirty nogood sonofabitch
now that cartman got kenny's feeding tube out he's gonna die for sure
the tube has been removed
how can they let an eightyearold decide kenny's fate
apparently some blessed child has done our work for us
good now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time
dude we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in
yeah
no
let's go to the uh media we'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing kenny
yeah come on
no no no boys aw goddammit
this is hbc news a righttodie case debate is heating up in colorado  where kenny mccormick's feeding tube has been removed by his bff  two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital
don't kill kenny
you bastards
don't kill kenny
you bastards
no no they're not killing him they're letting him die
you bureaucrats have no right to play god and take that tube out
nono see they were playing god when they put the feeding tube in
a woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient
get your manhands off of me
however a growing number of people are also standing behind kenny's bff eric cartman
we must respect the wishes of people's bffs otherwise all our bff necklaces would become meaningless
we all have bffs and we believe that a bff is the highest legal authority
that's right respect our authoritah
what mockery is this
my lord
the feeding tube has been pulled if the child dies and his soul returns to heaven god will have his keanu reeves
perhaps the child won't die in time
forget it i'm calling the attack off
no keep your army marching my lord i will get that feeding tube put back in
how
i will do what we always do use the republicans
we republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in colorado
removing the feeding tube is murder hughughughughughugh
removing the feeding tube is murder
who are we to decide if kenny should live or die
who are we to decide if kenny should live or die
it is god's will that he live
it is god's will that he live  haaghaghaghaghaghagha
no no you don't say that part
no no you don't say that part haghaghaghagha
jesus their army is massive
heaven help us
the biggest battle of all time is about to begin the battle of the feeding tube as people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention
we want all the country to see that kenny is alive and in pain
i believe the people at home see he's not in pain because he's a tomato
you say tomato but i say kenny
you say kenny but i say tomato
tomato
kenny kenny
tomato
uuhh excuse me i uh just found the last page of kenny's will
what
i found the page where kenny specified his wishes about being on life support
well what does it say
if i should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support please  for the love of god don't ever show me in that condition on national television
oooo
oowhoops
oh geez maybe we let this thing get out of hand this issue is so complicated but mmaybe we shshould just let kenny go in peace
you mean cartman's side is right
cartman's side is right for the wrong reasons but we're wrong for the right reasons
yeah
come on everybody i think kenny wants to be left alone
we've just received word that kenny mccormick has passed away the debate still rages on in america but at least now kenny is in a much more peaceful place
the armies of satan have already broken through the gate
we're gonna die
send our troops to the battlefield i'll command as best i can
michael michael  the humans finally did the right thing
oh my god they killed kenny get him into the command station hurry  satan's army charges tell our troops what to do kenny  so it begins  now we shall see the final battle between heaven and hell play out  yesss good kenny the angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers oh the cavalry angels are clashing with their black knights oh my god my god this battle is epic ohh they're bringing in their demon dragons look at the size of them my god this is even bigger than the final battle in the lord of the rings movie it's like it's like ten times bigger than that battle
no no how are we losing
the child's soul is in heaven god has his secret weapon
full retreat
patience my lord
no kevin  that's it i'm breaking up with you
yesss yes kenny satan's forces are retreating this is truly a sight to behold oh i wish i had a camcorder  we have done it we have defeated the armies of satan
kenny bless your soul you've saved all of heaven
yes kenny and to thank you for all you've done we are going to give you a very special gift for saving the entire universe from the forces of evil we give you this  keanu reeves' statue  congratulations

i've worked hard believed in myself and now i'm gonna be fighting in a state championship game  this is gonna be the biggest fight of my life
this is news  at noon
the colorado little league state championship is being played this week two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the majorleague stadium downtown
tom i'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents and i can't tell you how excited they are
i don't suppose you guys want to win this game
win why the hell would we want to win
yeah then we'd have to play this boring game all summer
little stan marsh is the pitcher for the south park little league team and stan how does it feel to be playing for the state championship
gay
mr marsh you must be very proud of your son
they've worked really hard to get here chris and you know i don't like to really trashtalk but i don't think denver has a chance
oho well i'm sure some of the denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team
oh yeah oh yeah  south park is goin' down feel it comin'  you ain't got a chance south park here we go denver here we go huh huh
who's that
that's tom nelson one of the denver players' fathers he goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight
there ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat denver not with my son on second base
oho looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here mr marsh any comments
well i think that there's a uh
mr marsh who wants to hear from a mr marsh iii am the ultimate little league trashtalking father iii am the bat dad
all right mr nelson let's go come on
bat dad knows no fear bat dad knows no pain i want you marsh i want you
well tension is certainly high here but i guess everything will be decided on the playing field
oh my god
good luck you're gonna need it
yeah you can't lose to us we're terrible
dude what are we gonna do we can't win this game
wiat i've got it you guys a fifth point in a sports movie the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team
like that motorcycle kid in bad news bears
exactly right clyde so what we need is to find somebody to join our team who totally sucks ass
hey yeah we need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world somebody who can't possibly win
but who
i know who
announcing the arrival of flight six seven three from new york city
i'm baaack
there he is now don't let him know we think he's a loser or else he won't play
hello cousin kyle oh jesus that flight was terrible they served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas
dude thanks for helping us out by joining our team
well you said you needed my help to win the big game so here i am i'll need a wipe cloth if i'm gonna play though sometimes i sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses
he's perfect
yeah with him on our team we don't stand a chance
i'm not gonna go
what
stan's little league game i'm i'm not gonna go
why
i just don't think i can all right
you don't think you can this is the biggest game of your son's life wny wouldn't you go and support him what
because i'm scared all right  you wanna break me down you wanna hear me say it i'm scared i don't know if i believe in myself anymore  i don't know if i can take this guy sharon
so then don't you don't have to get in fights with other parents at little league games just sit there and watch
look i get what you're trying to do you're trying to get me to realize that i have to fight him because it's who i am
no i'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself
i've lost the edge i'm sorry sharon but you have to take stan to his little league game alone
welcoem to the colorado little league state championship game  this must be pretty exciting for these youngsters a chance to go to the national circuit
you know what these guys look like to me a bunch of winners
yeah we're about to get our asses kicked
i don't think so you guys are way too good you're the best at this game
you're the best
you guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title

now butters there's no such thing as ghosts
but i saw him just as plain as i'm seein' you right now
butters these things happen all the time you've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you
ruh really
yeess
so so it was just it was just my ima magination then
that's right there's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real there's plenty of real things to be scared of like superaids
huh sssuperaids
that's right a new form of aids which is resistant to drugs just one teaspoon of superaids in your butt and you're dead in three years
aaah  oh jesus
so now you feel better ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of except the superaids
nuhnothing to be scared of jus just some lightning and thunder  gah wasn't nothin' neither jjust a mouse
butters
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
butters you have to help me
go away you aren't real
all right butters you leave me no choice
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

y yes yes sir
butters
ah
butters goddamnit i'm not in your imagination i'm dead and for some reason you can see me
but i don't want to see you
get a hold of yourself i'm the one who died and for some reason my spirit is trapped here on earth i can't find the passage to heaven
well how do you know you're supposed to go to heaven
what do you mean
well how do you know you're not supposed to go to you know heck
i'm not going to heck butters i'm not black all right
oh
now look i thnk the reason my soul is still here is because i need closure with all my friends and loved one i can say my final goodbyes to them through you
i can't ahah i have school tomorrow
this is your problem butters either you help me or i will haunt you for the rest of your life
helll uh all right all right i'll help you
mrs cartman
yes  oh hi
this is going to seem very strange and and you may not believe me but well your son wanted me to tell you something
oh what is it
tell her tell her that i love her
he says he love you
oh that's so nice
tell her tell her that i wish i wish i would have been a better son sometimes
he wishes he would have been a better son sometimes
it's just that it's just that i got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that i sometimes took my family for granted
he he got caught he got caught up in the rat race of of taking things for granted
oh that's so sweet oh i love you too poopiekins
kyle eric wants you to know that he's he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a nogood stinking jew  he's asking for your forgiveness and and he wants you to just remember the good times
just the good times
there were no good times and if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself
i can't don't you understand
he can't don't you understand
god forgave the jews you should be able to forgive me
god forgave the jews you should be able to forgive him
all right come on butters we gotta go tell token i'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black
uhh alright then
who was that
it was cartman having butters apologize for him
dude he did that to me this morning
me too
he probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle
that guy would try anything
yeah we know better than to think that
okay that takes care of token clyde and mr kitty that's eveyone i guess  all that leaves is you butters butters i'm sorry if i ever did anything to hurt you
aww that's okay eric
well it's all done my soul is at peace i think i can go now
so i won't see you again
don't be sad butters what awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss divine rest and ten thousand dollars cash
wow
g'bye butters i'm goin' to a better place perhaps i'll see you again sometime goodbye
yeh you're still here
goddamnit what the fuck is going on
well i guess saying goodbye wasn't enough
what else do i have to do
well well you know the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace sometimes you have to atone for something bad you did
atone
did you ever do anything really bad
not really
let's see oh and i broke mr anderson's fence and never told him about it
broke fence
i took a crap in the principal's purse seven times then there was the time i convinced a woman to have an abortion so i could build my own shakey's pizza i pretended to be retarded and joined the special olympics i tried to have all the jew exterminated last spring uhh oh yeah and there's this one kid whose parents i had killed and then made into chili which i fed to the kid
boy oh boy eric you've got a lot to atone for
really
really i mean honestly i don't know how you're gonna make up for all this
i know how
i'm gonna make make it righti'm gonna take a little time and set things rightmake make it righti'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels greatit feels so good to be making upfor all the things i've done wrongi know now what the good lord in heavenwanted from me all alongall along i'm gonna make make it right'cause jesus wants me to have a clean slatenot faking it i'm making it righti'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels greatmake make it rightmake make it rightgonna make it right girl i've got to have your lovin' tonight
well there's everything butters  i've made everything right
does this mean you have to go now
yes butters my soul is finally at peace it's time for me to leave  goodbye butters thanks for all your help be good and be safe goodbye  goddamnit what i've made everything right
oh jeez i i guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason
i want my eternal bliss do you think this is funny god  do you think this is funny
eric calm down  stupid butthole god
butters what have you done
ih ih it wasn't me ih it was the ghost
oh stephen i don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor
no i think you'd better call a doctor i'll ground him
what do you think doctor
your son is suffering from severe dementia he claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him this is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past i think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests
oh no  no
all right butters just try to relax  doin' just fine butters  just stay perfectly still now butters
lu lu lu lu lu lu
good you're gonna feel a little pinch now butters  don't worry mr stotch whatever traumatized your son in his past we'll find it
well after fourteen hours of testing i can say butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome you see butters when the brain wants to cover something up it makes up images and sounds for you to hear
so the ghost was in my head the whole time
now do you believe us butters
yes uh yes sir i believe you
good we're making a lot of headway we'll do some more testing tomorrow all right folks let's let butters get some rest
goodnight baby
ahhh
butters
aaaaaaaaaaaaah
don't worry butters i'm gonna get you out of here
please leave me alone eric my bottom is really sore
i found the woman you need to talk to for me look  doctor lindsay expert in the paranormal she can tell us what to do
eric yeyou're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event
she's gonna close soon come on
wuh i hate my stupid psychotic brain
hello ma'am may i talk to you
certainly come in  have a seat and tell me what it is you seek
well there's this ghost see only it probably isn't a ghost ihit's just a delusion brought on by my trauma well i'm supposed to heh help him find out why his spirit is wanderin' the earth even though i know that i'm most likely just completely insane
well many times the reason that the soul stays earthbound is because god is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose to help prevent an impending tragic event
of course that's it butters we had it wrong all the time
but now you shouldn't think you're crazy young man i see ghosts all the time
really
yes when's the last time you saw yours
well he's sittin' next to me right now
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
hey i think she could see you too you really are a ghost
i told you butters
this is breaking news
a tragic event is unfolding in south park three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the red cross
tom the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the red cross behind me and threatened to kill all the workers inside the violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash
oh my god this is it butters this is what i'm here to stop come on butters this psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day
stay back people

butters do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard
well sure i do
really
yes now sit down jimmy we should have a little talk  you see jimmy when a man's penis becomes hard the man puts it into a lady into her vagiiina  then the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy and after it's all done sneezin' milk the penis stops bein' hard and the man loses interest in the lady
so when your penis becomes hard you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina and then it stops being hard

dude come on we've gotta get out of here
with an eye on america and all of today's events it's south park evening news with tom pusslicker
herro crisis and fear tonight as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of beaverton colorado home of the world's largest beaver dam  earlier today a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives
oh my gosh those poor people
tom i'm currently ten miles outside of beaverton unable to get inside the town proper we do not have any reports of fatalities yet but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand tom so this would be quite devastating
any word on how the survivors in the town are doing mitch
wwe're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of beaverton uh tom but we're reporting that there's looting raping and yes even acts of cannibalism
my god you've you've actually seen people looting raping and eating each other
no no we haven't actually seen it tom we're just reporting it
you all done with your fishsticks stan
i'll help you sharon  boy that's just awful
in the nearby town of south park the cause of the beaverton flood is being investigated
that's right we know whose fault this is
huh oh
it's george bush's fault
yeah george bush doesn't care about beavers
george bush didn't break that beaver dam it was terrorists and al qaeda
they've been secretly building beaver dam wmds for years now
mom dad  theh they're gonna go help those people right
i don't know you know to me it seems like the mayor of beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago
don't blame the mayor sharon what about fema think this whole thing is really their fault
yebut uh ssomebody's gonna help the people off their their rooftops right
that's not important right now son what's important is figuring out whose fault this is
dude dude did you see the news last night
yeah
you saw all those people trapped on their roofs
shyeah that was pretty funny
pretty funny dude we did that that was our fault
hehey no no we aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam okay that's their fault
but they're trapped now and nobody's helping them
well they should've gotten out of there
maybe they couldn't get out
we did
dude ah i just  ah i don't know what to do here
ah ah ah ah i know what you're thinking stan you're thinking you're gonna go tell kyle look i know you think he's your best friend but kyle is a jew rat he has his jew ethics while he hoards his greedy jew gold and he will jew you out if you tell him about this
hey dudes  sorry i couldn't make it yesterday what'd you guys do
nothing
hngh totally
hey everybody they just found out what caused the flood in beaverton
aw crap
quiet children quiet we need to hear
at first nobody knew what caused the dam to break but now shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in beaverton was caused by global warming  it now appears that all rumors of global warming were true we were warned this would happen and we didn't listen  we didn't listen  all the top colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting
ladies and gentlemen if global warming has in fact already caused the beaverton flood then this is only the beginning the effects are going to spread what we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen
excuse me sir but when when is this going to happen
my colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests but we believe it may happen the day after tomorrow
excuse me i'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories doctor uh marsh but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists are you suggesting we shut down the economy
with all due respect clich dissenting republican the economy isn't going to matter the day after tomorrow
listen listen we've finished running the tests
global warming is going to strike two days before the day after tomorrow
oh my god that's today
we didn't listen
stan get in the car we have to evacuate
we didn't listen
come onnn come on
it's useless this traffic isn't moving
dad isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming i i mean the water was held back by a giant beaver dam after all
no stan i'm afraid us adults just let you children down we didn't take care of our earth and now you've inherited our problems
we didn't listen
we we didn't listen  come on everyone grab what you can we have to walk
oh jesus here it comes
global warming
it's coming here comes global warming
we didn't listen
come on hurry
it's right behind us  it's coming the other way
go back go back
everyone into the community center hurry go
get inside we have to close these doors
come on we've got to board up that last window seal off all the doorways we must try to protect ourselves from the global warming
mr garrison are you all right
i'm in pretty bad shape my leg is broken and my left boob is leaking
here you go sweetheart
mom you know those people in beaverton are still trapped in the flood
i know but i'm afraid it's too late for them sweetie we have to try and save ourselves now
shh shh we've got the television working
this is a fox news update global warming disaster
global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the colorado rockies all around the country panic and chaos are settling in
tom i am standing just outside of chicago where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths already we're reporting that the death toll here in chicago is over  billion people
oh god
this is all your fault jimbo
me
yeah you drive that damn suv around you didn't even think about global warming didja
can you believe it stan i never thought global warming could happen so fast i guess i didn't listen
kyle it it isn't global warming
huh
global warming isn't happening right now it's it's not what caused the beaverton flood
how do you know that
because i know what did cause the flood
george bush
no
terrorists
no
communists
no
chinese radicals
no
cartman
sort of
cartman flooded beaverton
shh not not exactly we were messing around in this guy's new boat and cartman egged me on and and i crashed it into the beaverton dam
dude you have to tell everyone right now
hey stan  oh goddammit you told kyle didn't you
stan people in beaverton are still trapped on their roofs nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside
oh here we go see i told you if you're so caring kyle why don't you share some of your jew gold with the people caught in the flood
look maybe maybe we can help those people in beaverton ourselves
how
why
we can sneak out of here get a boat and go help them off their roofs that way i can do the right thing but still lie about it
listen listen everyone nobody can leave this building
but we need supplies food silicone
you go outside and you'll die by now the global warming has shifted the climate  bringing on a new ice age within the hour the temperature outside will fall to over  million degrees below zero
jesus
all we can do is try to wait it out as long as we can
and the rest of the country
everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south everyone above this line  is already dead people like us in the middle states have to ride it out  the balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but new york  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast  what frank  aw awww goddammit
hello anybody we'd like to be rescued please any day now
why haven't they come for us
i i don't know
wait look here comes a boat

ohhh fuck it
what are all you guys doing here
i don't know i got this emergency letter from cartman that said to meet in his basement
yeah us too
ah gentlemen thank you for coming we don't have a lot of time so i'll cut to the chase the girls at our school have been hiding something from us hiding something huge
what
what if i were to tell you that the girls have a device which allows them to see into the future
what
how do you know
the girls do not have a device that shows them the future cartman that's retarded
you sir mocked cartman before yet you two sit here demanding answers  now damn you let him speak
thank you clyde uh i'm afraid it's true  i secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my wellington bear video camera  i caught the following images on tape i warn you this images maybe be too shocking for young children
okay i'm not lookin'
video playback initialized
okay okay my turn do me now
okay bebe what do you want to know
i want to know if i'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future
okay let's find out ready  pick a number
four
one two three four okay pick a color
blue
blue all right pick another color
red
'kaaay okay will bebe live in a big mansion in the future  definitely yes
all right
woohoo you rock bebe
whoa wow
do me next i wanna know if i'm gonna marry somebody cute
i'll do it i'll do it  pick a number
three
one two three now pick a color
where did they get that thing
green
now blue
the answer is no
aw dangit
oh my god how does it know the answer
i don't believe it
believe it the girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer freeze image  gentlemen we have to get our hands on that device
how is the incubation shield coming clyde
it's all set once we have the device it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with
good man any luck here
the outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals inside are colors which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp
good keep working we want to know all we can before we try to operate it  all right gentlemen our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete all that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here
let's go take it
don't be a fool craig do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over
so what do you suggest
heidi turner  is going to have a slumber party on thursday night there's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the futuretelling device there if we can get somebody invited to that slumber party not only can we get a hold of the device but find out how to use it
yeah there's just one problem a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party
no not a boy but a girl one of us is gonna have to go undercover show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town
you mean like that movie juwanna mann
no not like juwanna mann kevin okay it's way cooler than that
but if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class the girls will wonder where that boy went
which is why we have to fake that boy's death it's simple spy stuff my friends take your top man fake his death then send him in disguised as the enemy
that's a pretty solid idea but who
mr and mrs stotch
yes what is it officer
you'd better come quick
your son is at the bowery building threatening to kill himself
what
don't do it son you have too much to live for
oh my god butters

you're saying if i dig up my son's body and rebury him at the old indian burial ground that i
don't do it stotch what comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in the indians knew that that's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour i'm just here to talk you out of it  don't bury your son's body at the indian burial ground stotch the one that's right up over there behind andersons' bar sometimes dead is better

tango tango tango we've got it let's get it to the containment center go
come on butters
no that darn device is nothin' but trouble ah i'm done and i'm goin' home to tell my mom and dad i'm not dead
what the hell
haahahaha we have the device now the power belongs to us
anybody have a piece of notebook paper so i can make another one
go go get in the containment field
stephen you did what
i had to linda if there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back i don't know i don't know what i'm doing anymore
you dug up our son's body performed some kind of pagan ritual
linda i did it for you you wanted him back so much so did i
not like this  not like this he wouldn't be our son stephen he would be a walking abomination an unholy demon spawn
hello
it's him
keep the door locked
mom dad uh it's me butters i'm back
oh god  no
it's gone dear it's gone forgive me
hey mom and dad i'm not
oh god it's terrible what have i done
uh i guess you're probably a little surprised to see me
it isn't right make it go away
gentlemen this is a historic day for all of the boy and mankind in a few moments we will know the future
hohold on on guys we're not sure what this device is capable of maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it
no no we don't have time for that stan it's time to ask questions
how come you get to use it first
because i do clyde
i wanna use it
i'm askin' the first question let's just start with something simple will kyle die before he's twenty
wait i don't wanna know that
ask if the broncos are gonna win on sunday
nah dude then it won't be fun tow watch
will you all shut up so i can do this
you shut up asshole
i don't wanna know when i'm going to die fatass
guys guys guys stop  look at what this thing is doing to us butters was trying to tell me something outside the house that this device is nothing but trouble i think i know what he meant now
how could be nothing but trouble
we risked everything to get it from the girls how long before the girls attack us to get it back
yeah forget about the girls what about if the cia or or the russians know we have this they'll come after us for sure
maybe we should take it so someplace safer
and then what hide it forever from the government from the terrorists who want to use it for evil maybe maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power
you mean destroy it
are you guys nuts after everything we've gone through
we got it away from the girls that's what matters but now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves then we're no better than they are
think of the power
it's too much power for anybody stan's right it has to be destroyed
are we sure about this we'll never know the future
nobody will that's the way it's suppose to be hit it kenny
damn ken
here here you see it's going to be all right hello son
hi dad
he was supposed to stay dead

mr garrison ohoh jezuth
just let me say what i came here to say i know we had a falling out and things were said that shouldn't have been said i want to apologize for calling you a faggot
that's that's wonderful mr garrison
well wait wait it gets better i've forgiven you for walking out on me after i had my sex change and uh  and i'm ready to take you back mr slave
ooooo
well give us a kiss
say honey is that the pizza
what the hell is he doing here
mr garrison al and i have been living together for a few months
well that didn't take you long did it
slave should i leave you two alone
yes
no  mr garrison there's something you should know al and i are getting married
married
yes
you can't get married you're faggots
oh jesus christ
mr slave i am legally a woman now if you wanna get married you have to marry me
oh that's not true colorado is about to pass a bill which allows samesex marriage
we're getting married right after the bill passes on saturday
oh that's just great they're gonna let queers and homos get married huh
okay that's enough out mr garrison
we'll just see about this you fudgepackin' fags i'll stop that gaymarriage law
oh my god you're just saying that because you're jealous
jealous of what i'm doin' this out of principle to protect the sanctity of marriage  fags are gettin' married over my dead body
hello oh hey dude
so what are you and wendy doing
oh we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg we figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an a
uh huh
i don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking this whole assignment is stupid
yeah well so is your hat
stan i need you to watch the egg for a while
i can't i'm busy
i've been looking after it all day i have to go to the hair salon and the candy store
so take it with you
stan this is our egg we're both supposed to take care of it
well maybe i didn't want to have an egg with you okay bebe
well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now we're going to get graded together it's your egg too own up to your responsibilities
these homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions well i say marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman
who is that lady
i don't know but she is pissed
they passed this law behind our back we need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay that homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions and there is only one way for us all together to make that message very clear we need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them  come on everybody let's get some queers and some trucks and have us a good oldfashioned fag drag
well uh we were thinkin' we would you know just go appeal to the governor
appeal to the governor ohcome on where's your balls fag drag
we don't hate homosexuals we we we just don't want them to be able to marry
yeah we were just thinkin' o' goin' and askin' the governor to veto the bill
yeah
eh fah fag drag
governor we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gaymarriage bill
oh jeez i knew this would happen first the gay people come in here wanting equal rights then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it gt why do i have to make this decision gt
because you're the governor
i just wanted a big house and lots of respect i didn't want this kind of responsibility  i mean i don't know anything about gay marriage what argument can i use to deny them their right to a family
well think of the children if you allow gays to get married then you're also givin' them full rights as parents to adopt you think kids can be raised by queers
i can't use that argument there's never been a study done which proves that either way
but if you had such a study a scientific study which proved samesex couples are incapable of raising a child
then i would have something to fall back on sosomething to take all the pressure off of me
mr governor i will get you that study
hey wendy how's your egg doing
oh great it's a pretty easy project kyle's really good with the egg
yeah  i wish i had a partner like kyle i went to go pick up the egg from stan yesterday and his dog had it in its mouth our egg isn't gonna last a week with stan around
okay students change of plan  you've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs but now we're going to mix it up a little wendy and kyle will no longer be together
ha
let's see what happens when we put two samesex couples together to take care of an egg shall we kyle you are now with stan and wendy is with bebe
why
come on bebe we'll take your egg for you and wendy to look after
oh goodie
and we'll just take this egg for stan and kyle to look out for
no no that's my egg
wendy we're doing an experiment  here you go boys
but i made that egg mr garrison please youyou can't give my egg to stan he'll break it
hoh now what makes you say that wendy i'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine  and if not we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned governor won't we
who
never mind just carry on children just carry on as two reckless little boys will
okay there now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked
alright give it to me i'll take it home tonight
look stan you want me to just take care of this egg
why do you say that
it's just that i really need this a stan and bebe did say you almost broke your last egg
that's because i was pissed off
at who  heh hang on
i wanna see my egg
huh
i want to see my egg
wendy it isn't your egg anymore
yes it is i made it i decorated it
well you might have made it but we're the ones who are taking care of it now you have your own egg to look out for
i just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes
wendy i just wanna get an a okay let's not make this any more confusing than it already is ltgt
don't let anything happen to it please
wendy nothing's gonna happen to the egg you can have it when the week is over and i have my grade  freakin' weirdos man
you think you're so great don't you well guess what maybe i don't need your help i'm taking the egg home tonight and i'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that i'm every bit as good an eggtakecareover as you
what the hell is wrong with everybody
okay children it's wednesday time for an official egg check heidi and eric
our egg is fine
okay annie and timmy
timmiih
good millie and clyde i saw yours before class  powder and kenny
our egg is okay
now how about our gay couples stan and kyle
fine
what
no problems at all
that's impossible  are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me where's my signature
it's right there see
two boys can't possibly take care of an egg
dude it's totally fine
it isn't fine it has two daddies you call that fine it may be fine on the outside but inside it's confused and embarrassed look at the freak egg it has two daddies  two daddies two daddies come on class let's rip on the freak egg two daddies two daddies
tom i'm standing outside the governor's office where in just two days the governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage samesex couples from all over the state have shown up in support  while dissenters have also converged the governor is about to give a statement
i believe that i might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy people in the gay community want the same rights as married couples but dissenters don't want the word marriage corrupted so how about we let gay people get married but call it something else  you homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples but instead of referring to you as married you can be butt buddies  instead of being man and wife you'll be butt buddies you won't be betrothed you'll be butt buddies get it instead of a bride and groom you'd be butt buddies
we wanna be treated equally
yyou are equal it's just that instead of getting engaged you would be butt buuuddies and everyone is happy
well what about lesbians
well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes  oh god i was sure that would work
damnit damnit stan and kyle's egg is still doin' fine those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan  yes what  what the hell is this
i broke the egg
you broke your egg uh but you're partnered with a girl
i tried to cover it up tried to put it back together with modeling glue tried to seal it with a soldering gun but i give up i can't hide it i broke the egg
did you tell anyone else about this
no
did you tell your egg partner heidi
no that's why i'm here i think you should still give heidi an a on the project you see i broke the egg not her and so i should get an f and she should get an a which means that together the grade should average out to c minus for both of us
i can't do that eric
damnit i knew you'd say that you always have it out for me
you have to get an a eric here i'll sign this new egg for you we'll pretend this never happened all right  just put on the old hair color in the same eyes there we go good as new  go enjoy the rest of your recess
mr garrison you've never been this cool to me before
okay well you're welcome eric now just run along
why are you doing this
because i'm a nice teacher all right
what do you want from me
nothing it's all okay just take your damn egg
no
eric you've never been anything but a problem for me you're taking that egg and if you break it again i'll break both your legs and burn down your house do you hear me
yes teacher
get out of my face  urrgh this scientific study isn't turning out the way i planned looks like i'm gonna have to intervene
are you jakartha
who the hell are you
mrs garrison i spoke to your associates on the telephone
ahh yes you are interested in my services
i have a little problem i need taken care of i heard you're the best
who do you want me to kill  what is this

i don't care scramble it fry it do what you will it has to look like an accident
i am a serious assassin get out of my face
what's the matter you afraid you can't do it can't say that i blame ya that egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one  i guess you're not as good as they say you are
i am the greatest killer the world has ever seen
then why are you scared of one little egg
i will murder that egg then i will make it curse the day it was laid
that's more like it
day five i made it  hello
dude did you hear what's happening

garrison is taking us all on a field trip today he wants to do the final egg check in front of the governor's office
governor's office
she's really taking this grade seriously stan i'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together all right
aah you'd like that wouldn't you i took care of this egg kyle not you
okay stan you've been an asshole to me all week what is up
what's up oh nothing except that you've been trying to impress wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole
impress wendy
you've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and i'm just a loser
what the hell are you talking about
well guess what i'm gonna take this egg to class myself and i'm gonna hold it up in front of wendy and say see i'm every bit as good as kyle is
almost too easy
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
stan
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
stan stan i think we should talk
dude you should just go be with wendy and be happy
stan i don't like wendy  all i cared about was getting an a in this stupid project
yeah well i blew it now we're gonna fail and wendy thinks i'm a total loser
i thought you didn't care about wendy anymore
i don't she's totally lame
stan there was never anything between wendy and i  i wouldn't go out with my best friend's exgirlfriend
i'm sorry i didn't trust you kyle i'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have
yyeah well ii'm sorry i didn't trust you either
huh
it was really important for me to get an a stan and bebe said you were so reckless with your egg so i made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me
that  that's the real egg with garrison's signature
yeah dude i'm sorry
then then wendy won't think i'm a total loser
yeah and i can still get my a
come on buddy let's go
stan  do you really think my hat is stupid
as a matter of fact i think it is the nicest hat i've ever known  come on
today is a very big day in which i'm supposed to make a very big decision as some of you know my biggest issue with gay marriage regards childrearing and a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision
a new study
here with the results of that study is the lovely mrs garrison
thank you governor
oh jesus christ
ladies and gentlemen with the help of some adorable fourthgrade students we've completed our scientific nonbiased study of fags having kids come on up children  the parents were grouped together as male and female as you can see
uh mrs garrison you have an emergency phone call
yes what is it i'm a little busy
mr garrison it's kyle our egg is okay we'll be there in a couple of minutes
what yyour you're too late
don't fail us we'll be right there
no you can' hello hello  you told me you killed that freak egg
i was sure i did
well it's here you'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked  haha anyhow as i was saying we put one egg into the hands of two male students
thanks dude
there over there  excuse us excuse us please
yeeeeaah
jesus christ
keep running
the the egg that the two boys were given just
hang on wait
in conclusion governor you can rest assured that
teacher our egg is okay
this egg is fine  gays can get married
noo noooo
gays can get married what
i now pronounce you man and man
boys i'm really proud of you you've done an amazing thing for marriage rights
what did we do
stan i'm sorry i doubted you you really made a great dad
like i give a crap about what you think wendy
love love lost long ago it was special then it's over nowguess that i'll never know how it all went wrong how how howwell perhaps i should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago
pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it i hope you enjoyed my report on the solar system thank you
okay very nice token thank you 'k kids looks like we only have time for one more speech today so let's have ah eric
thank you mrs garrison  my speech is entitled ginger kids children with red hair light skin and freckles  we've all seen them  on the playground at the store walking on the streets  they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs i'm talking of course about ginger kids  aww sick gross ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin red hair and freckles  aw nasty yuck  this disease is called gingervitus and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls
what
kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured  ah sick  gross  yeck  because their skin is so light ginger kids must avoid the sun not unlike  vampires
aaaah
that's not true fatass i have red hair and i don't have to avoid the sun
i was getting to that if you will let me  some people have red hair but not light skin and freckles these people are called daywalkers
ho daywalkers
this is all a bunch of crap
mrs garrison i'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions
kyle let eric give his presentation
it's not a presentation it's a hate speech people aren't creeped out by gingers
i am
kyle if you wanna debate eric you can do so with your paper tomorrow
fine i will
fine in the meantime shut your goddamned daywalker mouth  let's see where was i oh yes like vampires the ginger gene is a curse  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time it is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting in conclusion i will leave you with this if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one  think again
stupid supremacist asswipe
dude what's the big deal
what's the big deal don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to i have to disprove cartman's hateful rumors do you know any redhaired freckled kids
what about the foley family i think they're all ginger
hello
hey wuh i'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles can i ask you a few questions
sure come on in
mom dad these boys wanna know about us
what heh hello there kids
we came to learn the facts about people with red hair light skin and freckles
oho gingers yes our cute little redhaired rascals
i'm sorry but i don't understand you both have dark hair and brown eyes
yes we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' dna actually the odds of us having a redhaired freckled child were only one in four and still it happened three times what are the odds
a lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know  if your spouse is also a carrier then your children can turn out like them
each one of them's a blessing
oh yes each one of them's a blessing
huh blesseblessing full of love
thanks mom and dad
but it's it's not true they have no souls
no no i'm sure they do  well it was nice meeting you boys we've gotta get dinner started
i just had a couple more questions about
look boys if you really don't wanna have ginger kids marry an asian woman asians don't carry the recessive gene  i know a guy who's marrying a japanese woman very soon for just that reason
and so red hair light skin and freckles are all passed down genetically a child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins thank you
okay very nice kyle a little dry and sciencey for my taste but there you go  all right that's lunch kids we'll pick up with clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess
that was a very informative speech kyle
thanks butters
informative if you want to die  gusy don't forget kyle is a daywalker daywalkers are halfgingers themselves make no mistake ginger kids are evil you know who was ginger judas and what did judas do oh he just got jesus killed that's all  look i'm just saying what everyone else already thinks gingers are creepy and one night when you're all sleepin' in your room the gingers are gonna getcha they're gonna getcha
you buying school lunch today
nah my mom packed me a kosher lunch
right this way  you can't eat in the cafeteria
how come
ginger kids eat in the hallway
yeah go on beat it re rrretard
there you see this is what happens when cartman is allowed his right to free speech
that's just wrong dude i wish cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger
hey  that's a great idea
what's a great idea
can you guys meet me over at cartman's house tonight at around midnight
sure for what
we're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson
okay dude knock him out  dude dude okay he's out  kyle that's good  all right let's do it
eric honey time to get up for school
ed a fine time to leave me lucille four hungry children and a
poopsiekins  sweetie what is the  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i'm ginger
oh my god eric
help me hellp mee
well all his vital signs are still normal from his outward appearance i would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency
you mean
yes i'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus
and how could i become a ginger now i wasn't born like this
well the redhaired and freckle gene is a recessive gene it must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence
so i'm gonna stay like this forever
i'm sorry son  ms cartman could i have a word with you  ms cartman i know this must be very difficult for you i for one can't stand redhaired freckled kids but you need to understand there is no cure your son will be ginger his whole life you might want to just put him down
oh
agh excuse me doctor but it just so happens my mom loves me no matter what i look like  right mom  mom
oh yeyes of coursesweetie
all right but you're gonna have to take certain precautions now it's very important that you keep eric out of the sun the sun is his worst enemy
hey dudes what's goin' on  how is everything with you guys
wow cartman you look different
yes well it's interesting you should point that out kyle i went to the doctor yesterday and apparently i suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency
you meanyou're a ginger
actually gingervitus is the medical term
is that an umbrella you're using
yes kyle  the sun's rays are bad for my skin so i need to be protected when i'm outside well i'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way and now we can just go on with our lives as normal
wow that's a little ironic isn't it
what do you mean kyle
well i mean all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one
hm i don't really see the irony in that kyle
that's fine just get it out of the way
dude this is going awesome
maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time
hey clyde token sup jim
what are you doing
i'm grubbin' what's it look like
you're not supposed to be in the cafeteria
huh
you know the rule no ginger kids in the cafeteria
but it's me
right and you're a ginger
dude check it out
guys okay look maybe i'm ginger but i'm not like other ginger kids i'm still me inside
sorry if we let one ginger kid in here then the others are gonna start coming
yeah beat it j jackass
we did it guys we finally taught cartman a lesson i'll bet that now cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers
i want to thank everyone for showing up today i've called this meeting because i don't know about you but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against just because we have red hair light skin and freckles we're thought of as somehow less important and it's bullcrap
yeah
kids at school laugh at us doctors call us genetically inferior the world needs to know that we are people with feelings and our parents love us for who we are
my dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel
riiight exactly we can't let this go on any longer we should be proud of who we are think about all the great people in history who were ginger people like  like uh  liiike
ron howard
right ron howard and uh aaaaand
ron howard
right we already had him but right see ginger people go on to do amazing things in society we need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior that we are in fact beautiful totally awesome and supersmart it's time for us to take back our pride
yeah
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
we gingers are proud people we are the noble descendants of great americans like ron howard and others we will not be discriminated against any longer for we are a great race
yeah
red power
red power
red power
red power
i don't believe it
red power
should we tell him the truth
red power
nah let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer
red power
red power
better red than dead
better red than dead
better red than dead
tom i'm standing outside the denver center for the performing arts where the new production of annie has just premiered to cries of outrage  a rapidlygrowing organization called the ginger separatist movement is furious that the lead role of annie  is being played by a girl  who isn't actually redhaired and freckled joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson eric cartman
that's right this is bullcrap we true gingers are furious that the role of annie is being minimalized
what harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true redhaired community
the bitch isn't ginger she's just using makeup to look ginger and pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do

thanks jody gingers how are we feelin'  can i get a red power
red power
oh yeah that feels good doesn't it feels good to be proud of who you are now i don't think i need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there hate for awesome people like us and if there's one thing i've learned is that the only way to fight hate is with more hate we are not the freaks of society everyone else is
yeah
gingers are the chosen people the chosen race and we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife darkskinned rats that they are
hello there gary nelson with hilton guest relations just making sure you guys have everything you need
we're fine thanks

great oh and hey guys just wanted to say thanks for choosing the airport hilton for your conference
you're welcome now leave us alone  my fellow gingers i envision a world in which there is no hate a world where everyone is ginger and so we must gather together every child who is not ginger and exterminate them
huh
what
exterminate
now go go out into the night and take nonginger kids from their homes we will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in now i am not gonna live my life as a goddamned minority are you with me

hehe yeah hehe
are you in
totally
you know cartman is an uncaring bigoted intolerant asshole but i have to admit i had my own prejudice about gingers i think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences i mean cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night
hehe yeah heh
oh hey there

good times good times
llook is this a religion because my family is like catholic or something

so how did i do
well i hate to tell you this stan but you are one messedup kid
huh
yeah i'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed

well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for scientology i think it can really make you happy again
what what do i do
it's very simple we just need two hundred and forty dollars
stanley you haven't touched your food what's the matter with you
i'm totally depressed
what why
i don't know
well how long have you been feeling this way
i'm not sure but i need two hundred and forty dollars
two hundred and forty dollars what'd you do break something
no i found a selfhelp program that can cure me
oh jesus the answer is no stanley
but i'm completely miserable and these people can help
stanley i didn't know you were miserable
neither did i
stanley do you have any concept of money at all money doesn't grow on trees you know
don't you care that i'm depressed what if i become suicidal or or become an alcoholic like grandpa
huh
well if you really think your life is so bad stan why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings
well but but that's my money
yeah well just like the rest of us you have to make choices with your money do you want a bike or do you not want to be depressed
michelle our friend stan wants to have auditing
oho good you're going to be so happy
i hope so
it's the beginning of a whole new life for you stan see ya afterwards
great so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars  perfect we're on our way  come on over here and i'll fill you in on how the church of scientology works  you see stan scientology was founded by a great man named l ron hubbard  mr hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called body thetans
really
yes and being the genius that he was mr hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans  this is called an emeter it's the main tool of scientology you just grab a hold of these handles as i talk you through past experiences in your life i'll be taking readings here and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels
thetan levels
come on in the auditing room and i'll show you how it works  all these people are just like you stan auditing with emeters to get rid of their negative emotions  all right stan i want you to just relax and take hold of the emeter handles
so this is gonna make me happy
just take a few deep breaths and i'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels  huh that's that's strange
what
somethin  something's wrong brian could you come over here a second
yep oh hey there greg
stan
will you look at his thetan levels
huh well we'll get another emeter  this one's obviously broken sorry about this greg
and so we just try to analyze your personality and if it seems like you need some help then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee
well that sounds pretty reasonable m'kay
mike i need to talk to you
excuse me sir i'll be right back  are you all right you're sweating
take a look at this
what is it
the emeter results from the little boy in room d
this this can't be right
we ran the tests four times we used four different emeters
fax these results to the head office in los angeles the president has to see thus right away go  now
the boy is from a small mountain town in colorado sir
sir how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level he registered ot i'm only ot and i've been in the church all my life
i've waited fortytwo years for this day
sir
don't you all see what this means there was only one person who ever registered ot in the history of our church  l ron hubbard said he had lived past lives that when he died his thetan would show itself again our prophet has returned
uh stanley take the garbage out before you go to bed
i took out the garbage yesterday
right now stan
aagh  stupid dumb garbage
there he is
thank you for returning
he's wonderful  he's wonderful
stan what the hell did you do
i don't know
hello young man i'm the head of scientology it is  a great honor to meet you
all right what the hell is going on here
we've been looking for your son for a long time mr marsh he is the reincarnation of our church's most famous prophet
wwhat
scientologist's the world over are simply rejoicing at his second coming
look we don't want our son to join your group okay
we're not asking him to join us we're asking him to lead us
oh my god it's john travolta
is this where he lives is this where l ron hubbard is oh my god

hahaven't i done well l ron haven't you enjoyed my acting which film did you like best
wellh i mean you're not you're not like as good as leonardo dicaprio but you're okay i guess

i'm nothing  i'm a failure in the eyes of the prophet aaah
hey  dude i'm sorry i didn't mean it

tom cruise this is park county police please come out of the closet  everybody here just wants you to come out of the closet tom  nobody's gonna be mad everything's gonna be all right just come out of the closet
we're still not exactly sure why tom cruise is in the closet but i'm being joined now by famous singersongwriter r kelly
well i was just standing here and tom cruise locked himself in the closeti asked myself why won't tom cruise just come out the closetnobody has no answers and so i pull out my gun
please understand we just want what is best for your son the reincarnation of l ron hubbard must be taken care of he had many enemies
wasn't l ron hubbard a sciencefiction writer
yes but he was also a prophet who knew the secret truth about the nature of life
this is just too much
we want to reveal to stan the great secret of life behind our church the safelyguarded scientology doctrine please your son deserves to be enlightened
stan do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind scientology
sure
all right go ahead and tell him
would you excuse us please this is highlyclassified church information
aw rats
usually to hear the secret doctrine you have to be in the church for several years stan  are you ready to hear the truth
i i guess
you see stan there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed  an alien reason it all began  million years ago back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil lord xenu
ho ho ho ho ho ho
xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated  and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets  and then had those aliens frozen
wa ha ha ha
the frozen alien bodies were loaded onto xenu's galactic cruisers which looked like dcs except with rocket engines the cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet to earth and dumped them into the volcanoes of hawaii  the aliens were no longer frozen they were dead the souls of those aliens however lived on and all floated up towards the sky but the evil lord xenu had prepared for this
wa ha ha ha
xenu didn't want their souls to return and so he built giant soulcatchers in the sky  the souls were taken to a huge soul brainwashing facility which xenu had also built on earth  there the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material  which tricked them into believing a false reality xenu then released the alien souls which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion at the dawn of man the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto they attached themselves to all mankind which still to this day causes all our fears our confusions and our problems  l ron hubbard did an amazing thing telling the world this incredible truth now all we're asking you to do  is pick up where he left off
but i don't know any of this stuff
neither did l ron when he started he said he just closed his eyes and wrote down whatever came to mind you can do the same just let it flow
okay i'll try i just wish i could write in my room but tom cruise won't come out of the closet
i know we've sent nicole kidman up there to see if she can help
tom tom it's nicole
ah hi nicole
tom don't you think this has gone on long enough it's time for you to come out of the closet
i'm not i'm not in the closet
yes you are tom and you need to just end this and come out  i'm not gonna think any differently of you katie's not gonna think any differently of you you don't need to be in that closet anymore tom
i'm not in here though
yes you are
i'm not i'm not in the closet
then how am i talking to you tom  tom you can't hide forever just because the reincarnation of l ron hubbard doesn't like your acting come out of the closet tom you're not fooling anyone
i'm i'm not i'm not in here
yeah yeah
hey stan we're gonna go to the movies
i can't i'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church
look stan we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into
cult scientology isn't a cult kyle i've read all this stuff and it's based on fact
dude l ron hubbard was a sciencefiction writer he lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times
i did not those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth
what secret truth
i can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling all i know is that i was depressed before and now i found meaning
i didn't know you were depressed
neither did i but now if you guys can't accept this great thing i belong to then i suppose we're no longer friends
stan i just want you to know that i still hate kyle more than you
tom hey tom this is john travolta
oh hey john
tom you've gotta come out of the closet oh my god
l ron hubbard doesn't think i'm a great actor
mmmaybe you took what he said out of context okay 's like if you don't come out can i at least come in and talk to you
oh okay but no tricks
no tricks  hey it's really nice n here
yeah see
i feel really safe oh my god
hello  hey come out of there
tom it now appears that john travolta is also in the closet and he refuses to come out here with more details once again is r kelly
i was just standing here tom cruise locked himself in the closetthen john travolta come and now john travolta in the closet tooplease tom cruise and john travolta come out the closetbut then i calm myself down and i pull out my gun
oh geez here we go with the gun again
yes yes oh this is great stan
i wrote that um our followers shouldn't fly in dcs anymore because they're too much like xenu's evil cruisers
yes of course so wonderful
and i wrote that the evil lord xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail
yes of course
and best of all i wrote that all the scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong
what
i i realize that to really be a church we can't charge people for help
what are you stupid then how do we make money from those people
well it's not about the money it's about the message right
wait a minute whoa whoa you don't actually believe this crap do you dummy brainwashed alien souls emeters and thetan levels those people out there buy that crap and i thought you were smart enough to see what was really going on
but you said that there were
what's better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you  having them pay you for it stupid
but then why me why do you need me to write something so badly
because if those people all think you're the reincarnation of l ron hubbard then they'll all buy your new writings and you and i together will make three million dollars
three million dollars
that's how the scam works but this is a scam on a global scale do you fucking get me now
yeah yeah i get you
then keep writing l ron your people are waiting
breaking news here in south park tom cruise and john travolta still will not come out of the closet park county police have decided to try a new method
i've been asked to come up here get you both out of the closetman this is some crazy shit why won't you both just come out the closetand they said
we're not comin' out the closet so you can just go away
but everyone wants you out the closet
that doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay
now i'm startin' to get angry so i pull out my gun
my fellow scientologist's our prophet has finished his new doctrine and will now read some passages before making it available to you all for a nominal fee  i give you the reincarnation of l ron hubbard
uh thanks so first of all i've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called nubanon
ohhhh
nubanon
and uh oh  i i can't do this
huh what
look everybody we're all looking for answer you know we all want to understand who we are and where we come from but sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we believe just about anything
huh
what
i'm not the reincarnation of l ron hubbard and scientology is just a big fat global scam
oh we are gonna sue you

jambu jambu why didn't you speak up before
i'm sorry sometimes i can't talk it's because i'm very very sick you see
sick
i don't believe it
yes because i'm not used to the earth atmosphere you see my name is actually willzyx and i'm from the moon
the moon
the that's where all orca whales are from if i don't get back to the moon i'm going to die
you live on the moon
i used to i wish i could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again
oh my god
why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park
i can't tell them because they're evil communists from the horsehead nebula they want to kill all us zypods so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform
that's terrible
dude dude the boss is coming
uh uh sorry boys i can't talk anymore i'm too sick  can't talk any more
alright guys listen up this may sound a little strange but the whale at the denver sea park is going to die unless we get it to the moon
well okay let's do it
the whale's name is willzyx and he told us he's dying on our planet we've come up wth a plan but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work
a whale talked to you
it's true the whale talked to all of us in between shows at his orca tank
hey that whale talked to me too after everyone left the show i walked up to the glass and he started talking
wehwell why didn't you tell anybody
well i thought i was crazy he said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up
well you're not crazy the whale talked to all of us and he needs our help getting him home
so it's true
nobody else is going to help him you guys we've got a chance to do something pretty special here are you with us
what do we do
stan
all right in order to make our plan work we're going to need the pool from clyde's back yard timmy's wheelchair the russian government and all of our skateboards
timmihhhhh
craig token get the slings ready
shhh willzyx don't say anything we're gonna bust you out of here
dude did you see that episode of trading spouses last night that was insane yeah well ha whoa what the hell
how could you not have seen anything it's a whale for christ's sake
it must have been taken while i was going to the bathroom
were you in there for three hours
don't yell at me
what happened
somebody kidnapped jambu took him right out of the park
what how
i don't know
all right people it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animalrights group those bastards have done stuff like this before
sir sir we've found a note
a note let me see that  we're taking willzyx home to the moon long live the zypods  what the hell does that mean
harris run a fingerprint on that note  nelson find out what kind of crayon it was written with  we'll find out who was responsible for this
we have to tell them we know what those boys look like
we can't tell them then they're they're gonna think this is all our fault
it is all our fault
how were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it
i shouldn't have laughed all those times we've messed with those kids' heads i shouldn't have just sat there and laughed
don't you say that it was funny it was really funny we've just  we've just gotta make this right ourselves
how
we've gotta track down those kids before the police do
comrades i'm afraid our situation is dire the economy is stale and i very soon mother russia will no longer be a country
sir sir somebody is on telephone another rich american wants to fly into space
hello hello this is russian president
hi my name's kyle uh i understand that your country flies people into space for money
yes we certainly do  what were you looking for
i need to book one trip to the moon please right away
the moon that is quite large trip but i'm sure we can do it
you can awesome
it sounds like we're in business we will just need say twenty million dollars
twenty million  are you nuts we don't have that kind of money
what
but you need to understand we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon
goddamnit it is prank call again  kiss my ass george bush this is not funny
what happened
they want twenty million dollars
twenty million just to go to the dumb moon
that was it that was you guys' whole plan ask the russians to take the whale to space
they were going to do it for that 'n sync guy
oh jesus now what are we gonna do
all right look there's gotta be other thirdworld countries with space programs we've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper that's all
well we can't keep the whale out here anymore people are gonna see it
a beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the denver sea park a full investigation is underway but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one whale of a problem
thanks tom i'm here at the denver sea park where believe it or not dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale
that's right we are members of the animal liberation front whales do not belong in tanks they belong in the ocean we applaud whoever did this noble deed set the whales free

hello again everyone my name is michael and i'm an alcoholic
hi michael
as most of you know i once lost my job and my family because of my drinking but with the help of aa i've been sober for ten years now  anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups for starters
my name's bill and im an alcoholic
hi bill
hi bill
i've been using the step program for about two months now and and i'm really turning my life around no more blowing guys on colfax avenue for a pint of vodka for this cowboy
that's great and i understand this is somebody's first aa meeting is that right ltgt yyes you sir stand on up and introduce yourself
um my name's randy and i just really like beer
you have to admit you're an alcoholic
but i don't know if i'm really an alcoholic
then why are you here
because i got a dui and so i'm required to attend aa meetings for two weeks i was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car that was dumb and i'm not gonna do it again
randy you are powerless to make that decision the only thing that works is the step program  step  is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking only then can you move on to the other  steps like believing that only a higher power god makes you stop drinking and then turning your life over to that god and humbly asking god to remove your weaknesses
what wait wait hold on i never knew that alcoholics anonymous was a religious thing
well it's not religious you just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness that's the step program not religion
look i i really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again
you just can't cut down on your drinking randy you need to know something you have a disease
uh a disease
that's right alcoholism is a disease you're sick randy you're very very sick and just like with most diseases you can't cure it yourself and it's deadly
oh my god
dad what the hell are you doing
hello stan
dad it's the middle of the day i thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore
no stan you don't understand i have a disease daddy's very sick
what did you go to your aa meeting
yes they're the ones that told me i thought i could just quite drinking on my own but it's an illness son i have to admit that i'm powerless to this terrible disease
dad you've had enough just stop now
i can't i'm sick  it's not fair why did you give me this disease  stan stan  stan
aww goddammit
stan i need your help
dad what are you doing in grandpa's extra wheelchair
gotta try to take it easy from now on son get daddy another beer will ya
no you don't need another beer
i know that but this disease is just eating me up i hate my illness
dad you just need to not drink so much it's very simple
i wish it was that simple son but if i don't give myself up to a higher power this disease is going to kill me dead i'm afraid the only thing that will cure me is a miracle
es un milagro   es un milagro
tom i'm standing in the garden of st peter's church in bailey where what some call a miracle is taking place the statue of the virgin mary has started to bleed out its ass  the phenomenon was first seen by father harold barnes  who saw the blood coming from the virgin mary's ass late last night  people from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand
well we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray
why do you believe the virgin mary is dripping blood
well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world
why do you believe the virgin mary is dripping blood out her ass  as news of the miracle spreads hundreds are expected to show up here at the church hoping to witness the miracle and even cure their diseases
cure cure disease stan
my name is harry and i'm an alcoholic
hi harry
i've been sober now for five years and i i've learned that drinking ice tea and and getting more involved with my relationship with god is is is way more fun than partying
it it sure is
once i accepted that i was powerless to control my drinking and my life i i put it in god's hands and now these meeting are the most fun thing i do
yeah
ah excuse me who's in charge here
none of us are in charge we're all powerless
we sure are that's right uh huh
uh look my dad was here yesterday and you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease
alcoholism is a disease
no it it's not and yyou can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad he he's kind of a hypochondriac
it is a disease because it's a physical dependency that makes it a disease
no cancer is a disease my dad needs to drink less
he can't quit by himself none of us could he needs divine intervention spirituality
no he just needs a disciprine but thanks to you people my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself
young man do you know anything about the step program
yeah and i also know a thing or two about cults i was the leader of one for a while  goddammit
the crowd grows larger every hour as the statue of the virgin mary continues to miraculously cry blood out her ass a cardinal mallory has been sent by the vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not
right this way cardinal  the blood always comes from the same area sometimes a little sometimes a lot
it's a miracle
uh kay here we go
dad dad what are you doing
i gotta drive to bailey
dad you're drunk you're not driving a car
no stan you don't understand there's a church in bailey the statue of the virgin mary is bleeding out her ass
what
they say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power she can cure my alcoholism i'll be back soon
dad you can't drive your license is suspended remember if you get pulled over again you're gonna go to jail for ten years
alright then you drive
i'm eight
this is my only hope stan either you drive this car or i will
i sure hope this works no no it will work i have to put my faith in a higher power i have to believe that this will work  there there's the church stop right here stan
where i can't see
right here is good brake pedal left pedal  alright get my wheelchair out of the back
is this the line  oh god  is this whole line people waiting to be cured

sure randy go ahead
i'm randy and i'm an alcoholic
hi randy
but i put my faith in a higher power and i haven't had a drink for five days now
an update from the bleeding virgin mary statue
oh wait sh sh hold on a second gang
earlier today the new pope pope benedict the th himself visited the statue here in bailey to witness the miracle firsthand  it was an amazing sight to behold as pope benedict made his way through the throngs of people
right this way your holiness
the pope then examined the statue closely  after witnessing the phenomenon firsthand the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding virgin mary statue is not a miracle
what
having investigated closely the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the virgin mary's ass but rather from her vagina and the pope said quote a chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time  back to you tom
thanks edward that's a very shocking report
that means i'm not cured i still have the disease  bartender i need a drink three shots of mcallen two small bottles of vodka three bottles of beer and some jello shooters  come on let's go
randy uh what are you doing
you heard what he said  the higher power didn't cure me i'm powerless again
i'm i'm i'm powerless too
yeah me too
get me seven martinis
jack and coke
dad dad stop
i'm sorry son i'm off the wagon
dad you don't have to do this you have the power you haven't drank since seeing the statue
but the statue wasn't a miracle
yeah the statue wasn't a miracle dad so that means you did it that means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own
you're right stan if god didn't make me stop drinking then i did maybe maybe i can force myself to never drink again
no
no
dad you like to drink so have a drink once in a while have two if you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like then that thing still controls your life and 'n you've never learned any discipline at all
but maybe i'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing
naw all or nothing is easy but learning to drink a little bit responsibly that'sa disciprine disciprine come from within
how did i manage to raise such a smart kid
i've had a great teacher
thanks son
no not you my karate teacher he's really smart
oh well tell you what let's leave the car here walk home and watch the game like to have another beer or two
all right
come on  or maybe i'll have three beers
that's probably okay if you spread it out
well how about four
i think you're pushing it
how about twenty
that's not disciprine
right right does vodka count
dad
