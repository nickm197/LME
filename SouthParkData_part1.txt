tally ho
indeed
uh hi our friend joined your club a while back and now he wants to molest kids
what well well yes of course that's what the super adventure club does
huh
we travel the world and have sex with children
yes what else would we do
well we thought you went exploring and like hunting and stuff
noo no that's the adventure club we're the super adventure club  next week we'll be heading to the outer banks of the amazon where we will make camp and have sex with children of the ugani tribe then it's off to the mighty himalayas where we will climb k and molest several tibetan children on the east summit
dude
i know but it gets even better from there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the mele river in africa where the secret and mysterious hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis of course we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places so how would you all like to join the super adventure club
no
no oh really perhaps i should ask you again  how would you like to join the super adventure club
no
dude what are you doing
oh well it doesn't work on everybody  well so long then
just what the hell is that thing
what what thing i don't see anything
ha i knew it
knew what
the reason chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed by this fruity little club
oh son of a bitch
come on children let's all go home and make love
you need to see a psychiatrist chef it's for your own good
i just like to make love up your butt
oh my god
mr chef is it
all right come on
hello i'm dr neeland what can i do for you today
hi uh our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club
brainwashed
yeah he joined the super adventure club and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr
i thought that club was for hiking and kayaking
no that's the adventure club the super adventure club has sex with children
oh oh that's right yeah
doctor do you have children
why yes i have two young boys
have you all been sodomizing your children too
you say he's never been like this before
no chef has always been supercool
i'm gonna make love to the children
he's pretty brainwashed all right worst case i've ever seen
so what can we do
i'm afraid there's no simple answer when somebody's brainwashed it can take months even years to reverse the process
but we don't have years if chef keeps this up he's gonna go to jail forever
tell me what was chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children
having sex with women
then that's it we'd better get your friend to the peppermint hippo right away
all right guys be sure to tip the waitresses this is two for one put your hands together this is monique
aw come on children let's go home
this isn't working
well let's give it some more time kids

i'm gonna make love to you woman 'gonna lay you down by the fire
yay
chef
hey children everybody i'm back  ow
great shot william hit him with another
oh
chef
tally ho lads i must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls
where's chef what have you done with him
he's safe  he's fasting in the deprivation room and being read the super adventure club manual we've got to undo the damage you've done
look if you wanna go around the world molesting kids that's totally fine but why do you need chef
we don't need him he needs us our club offers hope do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good no our club has a message and a secret that explains the mysteries of life
oh jesus here we go
very well i'm now going to tell you the secret of the super adventure club
we don't wanna hear it
you see the super adventure club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time william p phinehas  phinehas climbed the highest peaks tamed the mightiest rivers  but every time he got somewhere he realized that other explorers had beat him to it  phinehas was depressed until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas  phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the aborigine children at uluru and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of nepal  but now the most wonderful part you see after having sex with all those children phinehas realized that molesting all those kids had made him immortal
immortal
he discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies  and when an adult has sex with a child the marlocks implode feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality so saith the ruler of bethos  phinehas traveled the world loving many many children and he lived for eternity until he was hit by a train in
do you realize how retarded that sounds
is it any more retarded than the idea of god sending his son to die for our sins is it any more retarded than buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years
yeah it's way way more retarded
well now that you know our club secrets it appears you  leave us no choice i'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to leave
we're not leaving without chef
if you choose not to leave then i'm afraid we're just going to have to  call security and make you leave  you'll be let out by security and it will be superembarrassing and everyone here will see  okay you know how like when you want people to leave but they won't leave it's really frustrating
we're not going anywhere without chef
cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome  you petulant fools you just had to push it didn't you you don't realize who you're dealing with here security  take these boys to the door
all right come on kids
no hey
haha look they're being led out by security haha
no you don't understand they've got our friend in the deprivation room
this is their house and they don't want you here
sorry dude but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend
and sex with eskimo children requires some special skills
chef come on
children
get out of here
kenny spin blossom nut squash
yeeeeehah
come on chef
i can't break these locks
here
run chef
what the impossible i made them leave
get outside
stop them
children run
stop
we made it
don't you remember why you left south park in the first place
chef come on
you sought adventure and why do people seek adventure because their lives have become dull and empty
yeah he wanted adventure not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap right chef  chef
don't forget all your training chef stay with us and your life will be grand and eternal
chef we love you
i'm sorry children
no chef they've filled your head with lies can't you see that
get the hell out of here children
yesss looks like our fruity little club is safe after all  no
chef
ack  ow oh ah oh dammit  ah awww
no
a mountain lion
we can't lose another member shoot it
ah
all right this
chef
a grizzly bear
oh my god they killed chef
you bastards you bastards
pity he would have made an excellent child molester
maybe maybe he's still okay  no really they say the last thing you do before you die is crap your
pooot
oh never mind
come on let's go
we're all here today because chef has been such an important part of our lives a lot of us don't agree with the choices chef has made in the past few days  some of us feel hurt and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us  but we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much chef made us smile  i'm gonna remember chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song  i'm gonna remember chef as the guy who gave us advice to live by  so you see we shouldn't be mad at chef for leaving us we should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains
yeah
he's right
and in the end i know that somewhere out there there's the good part of chef that's still alive in us all
is it working is it working
yes we've got a pulse
get him in the icu suit hurry  we have done it good raise him up  chef can you hear me say something

if only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are
ah thanks i was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so if you don't mind i'm gonna try to get a hold of him now
great speech
yeah well you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some
hello there i'm ranger mcfriendly i'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of south park you must be the little boy who wrote that song
yeah
uhh
ow
you son of a bitch do you have any idea what you've done
what
come with me
there look
smog there's never been smog over south park before
don't you get it when people drive hybrid cars they get so full of themselves they spew tons of selfsatisfied garbage into the air that isn't smog it's smug
smug
hybrid cars make better for emission levels but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug you can have smug in the atmosphere and you know what that leads to glodal laming thanks to your gay little song south park is now the second smuggiest city in america
this is a south park news weather bulletin
it looks like we have a smug alert here in south park our own keenan williams has the details keenan
thanks tom a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning  all those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of park and jefferson counties on the national map we can see smug over denver and developing smug in los angeles however san francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country
a smuggy day in san francisco town
sheila did you meet gail and brian
no hello how are you
really good really good
hey there alan right
actually it's alain
right right wwould would you like red or white wine
can i just get an empty glass
oh sure
can you believe all these imbeciles in texas they just put another prisoner to death
so what do you do for fun
we drink and take drugs
do you want some acid
oh no thanks we don't do that stuff
you will there's a reason most san francisco kids take a lot of drugs
it's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time
everything okay in here kyle
yeah fine dad
so much better here with the intellectuals isn't it boys  wuhh  mmmm
well maybe i'll take just half a hit of acid
i want three
no no i'm asking if there's a listing for broflovski in san francisco they just moved there
haha take that jew boy i guess you heebs can't even play video football
yeah you're right
you know butters you make for a lousy jew
well i'm sorry well it's just that i'm not jewish and now th
no no don't apologize you asshole
marsh
oh crap ranger mcfriendly
who
you'd better come with me to the news station our situation just got a lot worse
i noticed it on the computer this morning look here  this is the smug over south park it's getting bigger and gaining strength
the smug
the smug is getting so massive that it's moving west and fusing with the san francisco smug here  these two smug clouds are combining fueling each other  now take a look at this
what is that
it's the smug from george clooney's acceptance speech at the academy awards
george clooney's acceptance speech
did you hear it he talked about how people in hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes he even took credit for the civil rights movement look the point is the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it and is headed straight for the super cell the south park and san francisco smug is already at critical mass if it gets hit by george clooney's acceptance speech it will be a disaster of epic proportions the perfect storm of selfsatisfaction
we've got to tell the townspeople south park still has a chance to make it through the storm
what about san francisco
kid thanks to your gay little song there's not gonna be a san francisco
soo that's it people  when the smug from george clooney's speech hits the san francisco and south park smug we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen
are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all
if the smug clouds remain the way they are yes
this is all stan's fault he wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids
yeah good going stupid
listen though we all agree this is stan's fault there is still something we can do if we all work together to reduce smugness we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm at least here in our own town
then that's it there's only one way to reduce smugness we've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town
everyone get your hybrid and meet at dawson's
hey where do you think you're going
i'm gonna try and warn kyle to get out of san francisco
oh no you're not your gay little song got us to drive hybrids you're gonna help us get rid of 'em
how long do we have until the smug clouds collide
not long the smug from george clooney's academy awards acceptance speech has already crossed into arizona
the hell is that
wow eric you sure are a great guy for doing this
i don't have a choice somebody has to get into san francisco and warn kyle's family to get out before the storm hits
but how come we can't just take the bus on into the city
you don't know san francisco butters  it was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the s those hardcore liberals lesbian activists and die hard modern hippies young and old  i swore i would never set foot in san francisco god help me  all right butters i'll be tethered to you through this cord it's my only lifeline so make sure it stays taut if you stop hearing my voice for the love of christ start reeling me in with all your strength
i will you're really great for going to warn kyle eric
i'm not doin' it for kyle  i can't believe i'm actually going to walk through san francisco well here it goes
all right all right now get it into the masher hurry up
can't somebody else operate this i can't really reach
well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song shouldn't you have  keenan we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars how are the smug levels
they're dropping slowly but but we're running out of time
yeah it's like san francisco is more of a european city like paris or milan
butters are you there
i'm here eric
i've started to enter the smug i'm about a quarter mile in can you give me an el
you must be nearing union square did you see a fountain to your left
yes it's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store
wait uhh eh take your next right you've got to start heading west
turning right at o two four niner
that's it that's that the last one
keenan keenan we've smashed the last hybrid
harry the smug from clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system get everyone inside  god help us
butters butters i think i'm here  castillo
that's it eric hurry somethin's goin' on out here
mr broflovski mr broflovski there a smug storm we have to go
being smug is a good thing
oh my christ  kyle kyle
the acid dude i'm totally tripping balls
i'm totally tripping balls i'm totally tripping balls
we have to get out of here now  kyle kyle
and now the worst appears to be over last night's smug storm has left thousands homeless all across the midwest people are picking up the pieces cities like denver and south park are heavily damaged but still all right however san francisco i'm afraid has disappeared completely up its own asshole
no
i'm sorry stan i'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend
hey hey stan you're not gonna believe it you've gotta come see
what
it's a miracle
kyle
hey stan
dude what happened
we don't know we were all passed out and next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here
it's like you had a guardian angel m'kay
dude i'm so glad you're not dead
so i guess there's nothing left to do now but rebuild
yeah first off we're all gonna need new cars
and let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid right
no hybrid cars are a good thing
but hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug m'kay
hybrid cars don't cause smugness people do  look hybrid cars are important they may even save our planet one day what you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it
you mean drive in hybrids but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it
yeah
i'm  i'm not ready
i don't think i can do it either
it's simply asking too much
perhaps one day we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it but for now the technology is just too much for us
come on everybody let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers
well looks like you're back for good huh kyle
yeah i guess so
we just can't get rid of you can we you sneaky jew rat
don't belittle my people you fucking fatass
ah that's better
but the bubble gum prince wasn't afraid he knew that the land of chocolate was safe forever and ever  goodnight my little angel

oh randy hold me
the news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the muslim world  all over the middle east muslims are burning american flags and family guy posters muslim terrorist alzawahri made this statement
we are so super pissed off at 'family guy' 'family guy' isn't even that funny of a show a jihad on 'family guy' and the 'family guy' nation
so what happens now
we stay here through the night wait it out to see if they do anything if we're still alive in the morning  then we'll know we're not dead
it's okay
we're alive we're alive
everyone everyone listen fox network censored the image of mohammad at the last minute
oh thank god
well it looks like we've dodged a bullet
they censored the image of mohammad how
i tivo every episode we can go to my house and see what they did
okay you guys check it out
you tivo every episode of family guy
dude it's a good show
yeah lots of people like family guy
yich
peter i can't believe you invited your old highschool sweetheart over for dinner
you think that's bad remember when i auditioned to be david hasselhoff's car
hey there knight rider
after those bad guys kitt
yeah but dad why would you invite an exgirlfriend to dinner
perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous
nervous like when i had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain
pancakes for you captain
i'll be the captain and you'll be tenille
love will keep us together
hehaha heh
yich
but peter i don't wanna cook dinner for your exgirlfriend
well maybe we can just have tea
you mean like the time you had tea with mohammad the prophet of the muslim faith
come on mohammad let's get some tea
try my mr t tea
oh boy was that ever weird anyway i can't believe i invited my old sweetheart to dinner huh
that's it that's all they did
oh man that's not cool seriously that is not cool
what what's the big deal
what's the big deal you guys they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people  what you guys think that's okay do you care at all about people's feelings
since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion cartman
yeah you rip on people's religion all the time
that's different i'm just a little boy that's a cartoon millions of people watch it how would you feel kyle if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of jews all the time huh
uhhh
i'm telling you guys it's wrong it's wrong  it's wrong
kyle kyle what are you watchi
hey brian this is like the time i got a job as a carrot cake
gaaah it's family guy quick gerald do something
dad dad jesus christ
it's okay it's dead
you boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show
mom it was nothing mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea
you boys don't understand anything it's obvious that you all need muslimsensitivity training
welcome to muslimsensitivity training it is important for us to understand why the muslim feel the way they do and why we can never show an image of mohammad
no muslims can't show an image of mohammad
kyle you're not being very sensitive
yeah kyle maybe you think this is funny but the rest of us don't
let's all look at why muslims are upset  first of all in the muslim religion you're not allowed to have what  sex good  there's no sex until marriage in the muslim world  now this would be fine except that in the muslim religion you also can't anybody  jack off  okay jacking it is strictly forbidden in the muslim religion  and what do we know about the places muslims live they live in  good sand  now put yourself in the shoes of a muslim it's friday night but you can't have sex and you can't jack off there's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid and mocks your prophet well you know what i'd be pretty pissed off too
mrs garrison that is ignorant and racist muslims are mad because of family guy not because they can't jack off right wendy
yeah
attention students proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement
the hell's going on now
shh quiet students quiet
once again we have just learned that the family guy episode featuring mohammad was only part  of a twoparter and part  is going to air next week with mohammad uncensored
what
why would they
fox studios claims that the family guy writing staff has demanded the mohammad character be seen in full view  the head of fox had this to say
family guy is our biggest show if they insist we don't censor their work then we we can't
family guy  i damn you to hell
once again bitter riots have started in the middle east this time even more massive and terrorist leader alzawahri has issued a threat
seriously 'family guy' isn't even that well written the jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot when this episode airsour retaliation will be massive
retaliation oh my god m'kay
goddamned family guy now they're just provoking people it's like they want a holy war
does this mean we don't have school all week
you guys this is serious we have to do something
like what
we have to go to the fox network in la we have to go and try to get that episode pulled you guys with me
dude we can't go anywhere they've shut down the airports and the buses
then we'll ride our big wheels
to los angeles
if that's what it takes yes we have to talk to the network the family guy writers aren't gonna back down
well good for them they shouldn't the writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated
intimidated is that what you think this is about kyle
all right dude what the hell has gotten into you i don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the muslim people is real
all right fine kyle forget the muslim faith for a minute people can get hurt if ten people die because family guy just had to have their little joke will you still think it's funny  what if a hundred people died will it be funny then kyle  i'm going to los angeles i'm gonna do whatever i can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand somebody has to speak for the muslim people somebody has to speak for what's right
kyle kyle wake up  we have to go the terrorists are attacking
dad are you sure there's time
this isn't a joke kyle bombs have already gone off in six cities
no
wait a minute  where's ike
he was just here ike
ike
ike iiike  ike
ice cream i want chocolate
ike  this way  iiike
kyyyle
nooooo
come to try and stop me  it isn't gonna work
i didn't come to stop you i i think you're right cartman i want to help you get the family guy episode pulled
yeah well i don't need a partner on this  especially one who doesn't trust me
look cartman i don't know what's gotten into you but i i think it's pretty amazing and i think it's real you have to understand why i didn't believe you before
yeah i do understand kyle i've been doing the wrong things for a long time doing things for my own selfish reasons i just wanna do something right you know just this one time
it's a long trip dude you're gonna need help we can try and get the episode pulled together
you know we might not even make it into the studio
i know but just like you i feel like i have to try people can really get hurt and a joke just isn't worth that
so what made you change your mind
i got some sound advice from an old friend
well kyle we'd better get going
yeah
are you set
i'm set let's do this
all right let's roll
people people quiet please  we must not panic
well what are we gonna do mayor part  of the family guy episode airs in six days
i believe that professor thomas from the university has come up with a solution
thank you mayor  now look everyone muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what family guy is going to do because they've wrongly grouped us together our only hope is to make the muslim extremists know that we had no part in the mohammad episode that even though the episode aired we didn't watch it we didn't hear it and we didn't talk about it
so how do we do that
we bury our heads in sand  we take twenty to twentyfive dump trucks fill them with sand from monarch lake and then dump the sand along south park avenue by using approximately eighteen dozen shovels we can each dig a hole in the sand stick our heads in the holes and then have the person to our left bury them if we can manage to get every person's head buried deep deep in sand before the mohammad episode airs we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all
no no wait a minute  that's ridiculous  what we need to do is just the opposite freedom of speech is at stake here don't you all see  if anything we should all make cartoons of mohammad and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want look people it's been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately for the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it but those times are going to come and one of those times is right now and if we aren't willing to risk what we have then we just believe in free speech but we don't defend it
i like the sand idea
yeah me too
yeah the sand thing sounds a lot simpler
we're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand let's move people
we got six days to make it to los angeles if we keep our stops to a minimum we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time
yes and in just a few weeks from now family guy will be off the air forever
off the air but we're just going to try to get the mohammad episode pulled
it's simple television economics kyle all it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled if we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of muslims then the catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled and then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled and so on and so on until family guy is no more it's exactly what happened to laverne  shirley
whoa whoa wait a minute  this isn't what i signed up for i like family guy why do we have to get it off the air forever
because they made ffun of muslims and and that's wrong
but that doesn't mean it has to go off the air you should like that show your sense of humor is just like family guy
don't you ever ever compare me to family guy you hear me kyle compare me to family guy again and so help me i will kill you where you stand
you unbelievable son of a bitch you never cared about the muslim religion or the safety of people in america you just want family guy off the air
do you have any idea what it's like everywhere i go hey cartman you must like family guy right hey your sense of humor reminds me of family guy cartman  i am nothing like family guy when i make jokes they are inherent to a story deep situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a point not just one interchangeable joke after another
what are you talking about
you don't understand
i can't believe i let you scare me into taking your side you used fear to make me stop believing in free speech
well i guess you won't be helping me now no biggie i don't need you to get the episode pulled
no  i am not letting you go to that television studio and pretend to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air
well then kyle i guess we oh my god is that tim mcgraw
what  cartman
kyle stop it
holy crap
ahhh
stay on 'em  jesus mary
if you have children be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own
dad i don't wanna bury my head in the sand
it's the best say stanley did you eat your fruit rollup
yeah
all right make sure your snorkel is working  all right now get your head in the hole
dad this is stupid
stanley there's no time for your immaturity do it  all right sharon now do me
uh professor we all just thought of somethin' if everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left then who's gonna bury the last person's head
yes i'm afraid one person is going to have to be last and not have his head in the sand
i'll do it
dylan no
you realize by not burying your head in sand you'll appear to be a part of the family guy audience
yes i know
dylan please you can't
somebody has to do it sarah  you run along now and you get your head in the sand i'll be all right  you have to understand i'm all she has
who are those people
no  aaaah  aaaah
hahahaha so long kyle
you son of a bitch i won't let you win you hear me
suck mah balls kyle
are you the network president
yes mr president
we need to discuss this family guy episode mr president
mr president my hands are tied the family guy writers insist i don't censor mohammad
but mr president this is a matter of national security they must be reasoned with
mr president there's something about the family guy writing staff i think you should know
next week on south park the race continues cartman reaches the family guy studio and learns the shocking secret behind the family guy writing staff
this explains everything
as an entire nation buries its head in sand
the idea has swept the nation but where will we find enough sand for everyone
and the battle between good and evil is finally waged
kyle quit it stop it kyle
will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored will family guy be destroyed will television executives fight for free speech or will comedy central puss out tune in to see part  of family guy next week on south park
previously on south park
the popular cartoon family guy is going to show the image of mohammad uncensored
if we all bury our heads in sand  we can avoid being any part of this
i'm gonna do whatever i can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand
you just want family guy off the air
kyle stop it
so long kyle
you son of a bitch i won't let you win
mr president there's something about the family guy writing staff i think you should know
and now the thrilling conclusion of cartoon wars will not be seen tonight  so that we can bring you this terrance  phillip television special
say terrance isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the lazy j ranch
it sure is phillip but i do believe this steer i'm riding has the farts
oh look who's coming isn't that mohammad the holy prophet of the muslim religion
hey guys how's it going
hello mohammad we've read all aboat you in the koran
i'm here to investigate a murder
all right just what the hell is going on here
you censored out the image of mohammad in our television special
ey you guys know the rules nobody can show the image of mohammad anymore it's dangerous
but you ruined the whole show
look i'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network let's just forget aboat it okay guys  aw come on guys give me a break
we demand you rerun mystery at the lazy j ranch with mohammad uncensored
ey i run this network not you guys and if you ask me your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny no mohammad
but family guy is going to show mohammad on an episode that airs tonight
i doubt it i'll bet that right now somebody is on their way to fox network to demand that that episode be pulled
ma'am i need to speak to the president of this network right away
what is it regarding
it's regarding family guy i demand that the mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight it's incendiary it's offensive to muslims and people can get hurt it's wrong it's wrooong
okay but if you've got a problem with family guy you'll have to wait in line  that little boy over there has an appointment to try and get family guy off the air altogether
dude can i go before you
eat my shorts
what the hell is going on  hello  excuse me i need to get to los angeles  hello
starting in a small town in central colorado the idea has now spread all over america  muslims continue to riot in the middle east demanding that family guy not air tonight's episode  amd muslim terrorists continue to make threats
family guy better not show mohammad tonight i'm serious family guy isn't funny
osama bin laden had this to say
if you look closely at the writing in family guy you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot and i think that's totally gay
bin laden went on to say that if family guy shows the image of mohammad as planned the terrorist retaliation will be immediate
you one of them
who
how come your head ain't in the sand
so you don't like family guy either huh
i hate family guy
so what's your plan you're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air
not nicely
look kid if you hate a tv show all you have to do is get an episode pulled pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air
cool man
yes so my plan is to use this whole mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show i'm going to use fear to get them to do what i want
isn't that like terrorism
no it isn't like terrorism it is terrorism
i could do that
this is manipulation at its highest lever you should let me handle this
i'm a pretty bad kid
really what's the worst thing you've ever done
i stole the head off a statue once
wow that's pretty hardcore geez that's like this one time when i didn't like a kid so i ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him
you got it man you got it
seeya
i want to assure the american people that as president i have exhausted every possible solution unfortunately mohammad will appear uncensored on family guy tonight at seven
mr president
mr president can't the writers of the show be reasoned with don't they know they're putting the country in danger
i have come to understand something about the family guy writing staff suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence
mr president
what exactly did you learn about the family guy writing staff mr president
i'm afraid that information is classified
awww  mr president
mr president can't you force the family guy writing staff not to write anything about mohammad
couldn't you throw them in prison
look the fact of the matter is the family guy writing staff is protected by something called the first amendment
and what exactly is this first amendment mr president
uh you know the right to free speech
awww
mr president when your administration came up with this first amendment did it not foresee a problem like this might happen
well we didn't come up with the first amendment it was already in place
what do you intend to do about this first amendment mr president
forgive me mr president but this first amendment sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibberyjoob
yeah
that's right
okay let's discuss the fall lineup
sir there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the family guy episode
all right let's get this over with
hello gentlemen ladies my name is little danny pocket and i won't take much of your time please excuse my tiny crutch it's the only way i can get around these days ow
oh poor kid
you see my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of denmark his newspaper showed an image of mohammad and two days later terrorists suicides bombed his building i was in the lobby when it happened  first one terrorist suicide bombed us and then dozens more they just kept coming suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another they were like mexican jumping beans i just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt because that would be of course your responsibility  ow
i feel terrible it's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face
sir if we pull the episode the family guy writing staff will refuse to work again
little boy will you talk to the family guy writing staff if your story touches their hearts like it has ours perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode
i'll certainly do my best  ow
take this noble child over to the family guy offices if he can scare them like he has us maybe we can pull the mohammad episode after all
yes and then family guy is as good as dead
what was that
i i said thank you thank you for listening
thanks a lot for the ride
ey it's the least i could do i hope you succeed kid i really don't wanna see family guy go off the air i love that show
i'll do everything i can
i mean i know it's just joke after joke but i like that at least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages you know
excuse me  do you know which way the network president's office is
who wants to know
look my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting family guy off the air
the network president's office is in there
oh thanks dude
no problem man
hello this can't be right i  ow
cowabunga motherfucker
hello mitchell
oh hi miss travis
the president has asked that little danny pocket here speak with the family guy writing staff
are you sure they're working on a new episode right now
it won't take long sir  ow
all right i'll take him back follow me little danny  you must be excited not many people get to meet our writing staff
yes i'm totally excited family guy is so funny
well here we are danny the family guy writing staff
wha  what are they
they're manatees  gretchen and flubber are from the gulf of mexico tinker pete and lucy are from the caribbean sea
family guy is written by manatees  of course it all makes sense now
they really are brilliant creatures  you see the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls  each ball has a verb noun or pop culture reference written on it there's millions of them  the manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank  uh there goes gretchen she's comin' up with an idea oh she came up with gary coleman  the idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script  laundry date winning mexico gary coleman a perfect family guy joke i can see it now
peter you didn't do the laundry today
you think that's bad remember the time i won a date to mexico with gary coleman
qu pasa seores
whatchoo talkin' 'bout willis
waitwaitaminute waitaminute these manatees demanded that mohammad be shown how manatees don't talk
when fox censored the image of mohammad last week it also meant that the mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank it made the manatees very upset pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank and the manatees stop working hehere i'll show you  keith  all right all right put it back in  manatees are very ethical writers either everything's okay to write about or nothing is anyway the president of the network wanted you to speak with the manatees
oh yes yes um  hello manatees i i think you should allow the network to pull your episode with mohammad see i'm the victim of a a terrorist attack and terrorists might come after you if you
that isn't gonna work on them
why not
don't you know anything about manatees they're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats
son of a bitch
let me out of here kid why are you doing this
well well well
cartman
hello kyle looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well
you fat sun of a bitch
you came so close to stopping me didn't you kyle there was just one thing you didn't count on that more people besides me hate family guy
yeah
well a lot of people like family guy too who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air
shut up  you shut your fucking face man  did it work did you scare the network into pulling the episode
not yet but i've come up with a new plan i've learned how to make the family guy writing staff stop working as soon as everyone goes on their lunch break i can sneak back in
cool man
cartman let me out of this stupid net
good kyle that's good anger you're showin' there see that that's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline not at all like family guy now if you'll excuse me kyle  i've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank
what
i don't understand it what's wrong with them
we don't know mr president they just stopped working
but nobody took any idea balls out of the tank did they
no sir none of us did
then why are they refusing to write i agreed to show mohammad uncensored i did what you asked what do you want from me
sir sir  if you don't my saying i think you asked for this you gave in to the manatees last week now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want you spoiled them by caving in now they thnk they can walk all over you  sir you are in charge of this network not them maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge
you're right it's time i stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do i'm pulling the mohammad episode you got that and if you all don't want to work tomorrow you can just find other jobs  how long before family guy's supposed to air
twentyfive minutes
i gotta hurry
i did it i am god
family guy is going off the air no more family guy for me mon frre
cartman  you fucking fatass
how the hell did you get out
that kid and i had a long talk i told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you
aw god damnit you gave him one of your gay little speeches didn't you
you are not killing family guy
you're too late kyle the president of the network is pulling the episode family guy is as good as dead
there's still time to tell the network president you're full of crap
i can't let you do that
get out of my way or i'll kick your ass
fine kyle i guess it was inevitable  let this be our final battle  ow ow stop it kyle that's too hard ah  ugh kyle stop it
ow quit it
ow quit it kyle bleh kyle
stop it
ow quit it
ow quit it kyle leh kyle let go okay okay come on time out kyle time out time out time out  time in  i dow uh ah shgah okay okay time out kyle ttime out time out time out time out time out

thanks kid
network control this is the president i want you to pull the episode
what  mr president are you sure
i'm sure begin episode jettison sequence
abort system initiated
awaiting confirmation
mr president we need your final approval code
president approval code  destruct
sir mister television executive stop
who are you
listen to me the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child he only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of family guy forever
the end of family guy
mr president we need final authorization
hold on julie  what are you talking about kid
pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction you'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely it's what happened to laverne  shirley
you mean the manatees aren't trying to run the network
what manatees
go ahead mr president continue what you were doing
no you have to show mohammad mr president
mr president we're awaiting your orders
sir just think about what you're doing to free speech
no think about the people who could get hurt
ah i don't know who to listen to
okay i'll make it easy for you  pull the mohammad episode now
okay i'll listen to you  julie
noo wait you can't listen to him he's a lying deceitful monster who only wants family guy off the air
but he has a gun
you can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence
shut up kyle
i can't be responsible for people getting hurt especially me
yes people can get hurt that's how terrorism works but if you give into that doug you're allowing terrorism to work do the right thing here
give the orders to pull the episode mr president
i shouldn't even be in the office still it's supposed to be halfday friday
mr president thirty seconds to airtime what do you want us to do
do the right thing mr president
how about i allow the episode to air but just censor out the image of mohammad again
i wish that was good enough but if you censor out mohammad then soon you'll have to censor out more
no gay speeches kyle
if you don't show mohammad then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at and what isn't either it's all okay or none of it is
five seconds mr president
do the right thing show mohammad  do the right thing
mr president we need a decision now
family guy goes on air as planned uncensored
yes
no no i hate family guy
air it
peter you got a pink slip at work
you think that's bad remember the time i got a salmon helmet from mohammad while wearing a toga
coming mohammad
wow a salmon helmet thanks
anyway what were we talking about
oh yeah my pink slip
hey that wasn't bad at all they just showed mohammad standin' there lookin' normal
mr president the terrorists are retaliating
what
or the time i
as soon as the image of mohammad appeared terrorist leader alzawahri announced the retaliation
we warned you not to show mohammad but family guy did it anyways so now here is our retaliation on america

aha mmm yes yes i see well that's quite a fascinating story you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness
yep and it's all true
chapters  through  however seem to all be about doritos brand corn chips
i guess i could edit those chapters down some
don't bother i'm sorry to tell you this sir but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs
huh why not
well just the small trivial fact that people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels
wull yeah but maybe people will read my memoirs and like apply its lessons to their own lives
no they won't because they're people and you're a towel
you're a towel
no i'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs you're a towel
now what am i gonna do i gotta pay rent and i just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs it's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible i've gotta shape up focus an' come up with real solutions to my problems  i'd better get a little high  oh maybe i shouldn't
but you have to think of somethin' fast an' gettin' high makes you smart
all right i'll just use my special gettin'high powers one more time  hey hey wait a minute of course that's it why didn't i think of it before
all my life i've been a pretty irresponsible towel  person i thought i was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels  people  this is a really good idea
ogh oh my god uh i could not believe a human being has led this kind of life mr
mctowelie steven mctowelie
it's heartbreaking passages like this one i am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me i know this company would be honored to publish this book i just have one small question first you're not a towel are you
no if i was a towel why would i be wearin' this hat an' this fake mustache
right i'm sorry  well steveen if it's all right with you i'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now we're in business sir

well i guess i'm just an extraspecial tow  person
you talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack what would that do to you emotionally you have been through so much  and i think that people all over america could benefit
oh god there she goes again babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on she hasn't paid any attention to me in years
a life that kept getting up whenever it was down
nobody knows what it's like to be oprah's minge all she does is work never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again a minge needs attention at least a scratch once in a while
well steven your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet but i have some pretty exciting news for you
used to be a time when oprah would play with me night and day she'd pet me for hours usin' every finger now i just sit here in the dark not even so much as a pinky i should write a book be much more depressin' than his

yyeah you know mr gore uh my dad's a geologist and he said that manbearpig probably isn't in colorado

no
damn for a minute there i thought we found him
well this was a great meeting wasn't it guys but we gotta get goin' to school now
oh my god  manbearpig screen active what is this area of colorado it's a it's a cave of some kind
yeah that's cave of the winds it's a tourist attraction
oh jesus on ice skates we've gotta get down there right away
ah i don't think so dude
yeah we've got school anyway
i can get you all excused from school
you have that kind of power
look you boys have a chance to help me find and kill manbearpig once and for all i'm totally serial
hello everyone welcome to cave of the winds our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in colorado  before we get started i do understand we have a special guest in our group today the ex vice president mr al gore  mr gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here now once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules stay on the path and do not touch anything aright are we ready
yeah
let's go cavin'
here we are in the main chamber of the cave it was discovered in  and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the old west
have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmonlike odor coming from the caves lately
ahh no  now as you can see the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites water drips from the cave's
all right kids i need you to keep an eye out for manbearpig droppings
what do manbearpig droppings look like
similar to pig droppings but more manbearlike
these rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name for instance this one here we named the hanging mushroom  and over here we have man with helmet and two bowling balls  and finally of course the two sisters  now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of  degrees
groan groan
sir mr gore is there a problem
not yet
all right everyone if you'll step this way you'll see how the cave gets its name
kids kids over here look
what
i bet this is where he's hiding  this looks like manbearpig central come on  come on this is where manbearpig is i'm serial
in certain areas of the cave the wind actually blows through causing a sound you can hear
wow
take a picture of the sound steven
mr gore i i think we should stay with the tour group
wait shhh  christ he's here take this rope  be ready to tie him up  i've got you now you son of a bitch
what are you doing
oh no
no
aaaah
leave them alone you goddamned manbearpig
help
damn you manbearpig they're just children
okay everyone out of the cave now  go go go out now
hello
help
we're trapped in here
somebody get us some help down hyah
hello help
hello
hello
help
forget it they can't hear us
what are we gonna do
you'd better get us out of here asshole
me
you just had to go and be nice to al gore now we're trapped in a cave
maybe there's another way out of here
oh no kidding
aall right let's split up and look for a passageway eeveryone take a different direction  oh man we're in big trouble here
this is bullcrap if i'm thin i'm gonna be so pissed off  goddammit
you see anything kenny
no nothing
cartman cartman you see anything
no nothing  no nothing here nothing this way  tr treasure
cartman you okay  you need help
i'm fine this way is just a dead end coming back to you now
it looks like we're completely sealed in
yeah no shit
there's a small passageway about  yards over there but it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep
maybe we should go for it
you guys go on ahead i'm gonna stay here wait it out
why
i just i i don't feel very good i'll just wa i'll just weigh you guys down
cartman's right first rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued
no it's okay you guys go on ahead
no we'll stay here too if we start wandering off we're gonna get lost or killed let's just wait here and hope help comes soon
that's cool i just i just wouldn't go over there  if i were you guys i just took a huge dump
aw dude
the cavein was massive it has cut off all access in or out the children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area
does anybody know who these kids are
no nobody seems to knew them only that they were in the tour group digging to them is going to take days
excuse me excuse me this cavein was no accident and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast i am super duper serial
what do you mean the cavein is over
i'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cavein
what's that
what is that a pigbearman
no stupid it's manbearpig
i'm sooo hungry do you think people even know we're here
they saw us on the tour  dude where do you keep going cartman
i just nneed to keep taking a crap i got diarrhea really bad
dude it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes
let's just try to sleep maybe help will come tomorrow
all that treasure  it's all mine  so long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it  you would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure wouldn't you even though i found it you'd love to think it's somehow yours too god i hate you guys  especially you you moneygrubbing snake in the grass  well i have news for you kyle you're never going to get my treasure i've got a little plan going to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing
ccartman
oh hey kyle how's it goin'
dude what are you doing
not much you know just hangin' out how've you been man good
dude get away from me
yeah it's nice talking with you kyle see you around
why won't anybody listen to me manbearpig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance i'm serial
mr gore please we need you to calm down now wwhat exactly do you suggest we do
i told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead 'cause it's the only way to make sure manbearpig never comes out and i'm sane and i'm totally serial but everyone just keeps digging
well see the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead it will kill those boys too
they're already dead didn't you listen to me they got attacked by a manbearpig and manbearpig leaves nobody alive i'm super serial nobody will listen to me but i'm serial
do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here
naw i f i feel kind of bad for him i don't think he has any friends
all right gotta be strong  there's still a lot more treasure to go
dude he's really sick
it's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cavein three days without food and time is certainly running out the digging continues but progress is fatally slow
all right people we've gotta work faster our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called smuggler's den
smuggler's den
ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure here see
based on where the boys were seen last they're somewhere near this area hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put
stan stan wake up
huh what have they come for us
no it's cartman something's really wrong with him
meh meuh urgh  mbeuh
oh my god  cartman dude can you hear me
i'm fahn just a lit  no big deal  beh
we can't wait here any longer dude we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die
how dude we c we don't even know if that passage i found goes anywhere
maybe we should get out first see if we can find a way out and then come back for him
no don't don't leave me here you assholes don't leave me here to die
come on come on pull
goddamnit he's soo heavy
buh hurry you guys you gotta get me out of here

right then i'm going to have to take it
the hell do you think you're doing
come on  this video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores now first thing we're going to do is make your bed  eric no this is not acceptable
stop trying to bogart my xbox you fat bitch
all right that's it  you're going to timeout
time out
whenever you are naughty eric you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes
and what exactly keeps me on the stool
it's the timeout stool you can't get down until the time is up
whoa how did i do that
eric you have to stay in timeout
ummm no
come on you don't have a choice
all right seriously you're starting to piss me off now
eric you need to listen to me  this is very important i am getting down to eye level with eric so that i can talk to him on his level  eric you need to understand why you are being punished all right
i'm just gonna get down as soon as you move
well then i'll just have to stand right here  oh  he spit in my mouth
yeah it's best to avoid his level
all right i've dealt with this before we just need to use psychology on him
don't stop believing hold on to that feeling
eric can i just talk to you for a quick second why are you so angry
because you took my xbox
is this about more than your video game are you feeling angry at me because you think i'm here to change your life
well yeah
and you're feeling like i have no right to come in and tell you how to live
yeah i guess so
see this you have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings what else are you feeling eric
well i'm feeling confused because i don't understand why you became a nanny
me well it's because i love children like you
right but if you love children so much how come you're not a mommy
oh i just never had kids
why not
it just didn't happen
you're sterile is that it  no that's too convenient of an excuse the truth is nobody ever wanted to have babies with you isn't that it  always the mom's maid and never the mom must be hard on you knowing that the years are ticking away your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away drying up becoming totally worthless
why you you  you little bastard how dare you
eric naughty
what kind of  monster would
yes let the anger come strike me down while you can but it won't make your driedup ovaries any more fertile
that's it  i'm not doing this
oh but we really need some help
find yourself another nanny television show
coming up next it's super nanny where other nannies fail nanny jo comes through
this child's behavior is totally unacceptable
well there's no trial too tough for super nanny in just three days' time you're going to see a new eric cartman
i'm afraid super nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis
what do you mean
i mean  she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement
from heeell it's from heeell
oh dear i don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems we've been through every nanny reality show on television
well there is one more show you could still try
when good dogs go bad there's one man who's their best friend cesar millan
no dog is too much for me to handle i rehabilitate dogs i train people i am the dog wheesperer
please come in
so tell me what are the problems you are having with the child
well he's just out of control i mean he never listens to me and he pretty much runs my life
so the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house
you can stop talkin' behind my back i'm right here fruitcake
see i'm not looking at the child i'm not acknowledging the child i'm just letting the child know i'm not interested in him
not interested i'm me
see the child thinks your world revolves around him because it does because everything he does gets a response from you
yeah well i don't see why
tsst
hey
don't look at the child just keep looking at me let let him know we are having a conversation
mom this guy doesn't
tsst
ah quit it
what what is it that you're doing
dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck but it works equally well on a child i just use two fingers nip at the child's neck doesn't hurt the child just let him know i am dominant
look mexican if you really think that you can
tsst
knock it off
tsst see i'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response
oh that's very interesting
i think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise he's fat and he has all this pentup energy that
i'm not fat
tsst we need to let him burn off do you take walks with your son
well no i don't
go on take your son for a walk
ey you think this is funny you sonofabitch
see once again i am the one going for a walk it's about me the child is lucky to come along
mom this is degrading
tsst
agh goddamnit aaarrgh
don't look at him just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon
maaaa mommm  mommm
here why don't you try it now take your son
mom seriously people are seeing me
good just keep your confidence shoulders back eyes straight ahead the child can pick up on that confidence learning he's supposed to follow you not lead you
mom don't you love me can't you see i'm unhappy right now
tsst
mom
good ms cartman very good
and now back to the dog whisperer
it is important to understand that dogs run in packs and one dog is always dominant the pack leader
god dammit stop ignoring me
you must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy
ahall right
this is abuse i am a child and i am entitled to attention
tsst
quit it mom
it doesn't seem to work as well when i do it
okay let me show you how to express the dominant energy what i have done is i have brought over some kentucky fried chicken
ooo colonel
i am going to eat first because that is what the pack leader does
give give me the chicken ggive me some chicken
tsst
eh what are you doing i want chicken give me some goddamned chicken
i am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior now you eat the chicken
mom gimme give me some chicken i want some chicken mom
we won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior
goddammit i am not a dog  give me the chicken give give give me the chicken i want the chicken chicken  give me the chicken give me the chicken give me the chicken give me the chicken
we need him to become relaxed and submissive
gih  okay i'm fine i'm cool now may i have some chicken please

suck my asshole taco vendor

wow i have a lot to learn
mom i am serious this has gone on long enough get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken  that's how you want it bitch fine  i hate you i'm running away
oh dear
it's okay this is all part of the dominance struggle
but what if he does run away
let him go he'll be back this a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby
oh boy park avenue i'm rich

what is he still doing here
he said he's hungry what should i do
well let's feed it
what the hell is this skinless chicken boiled vegetables and salad this is just like auschwitz
this is more aggressivedominant behavior don't nurture it
oh my god bitesize snickers that's it i'm calling childprotective services
come on ms cartman you must become pack leader what do you do
eric if you don't want to eat then why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed
nooo you're asking him a favor don't ask a favor dominate
mom i want this guy out of here you got it if he's not gone in two minutes i will call social services on you
you project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it i promise shoulder back head high don't reason with it don't argue with it just dominate it
i am your son and you will listen to me you have no right to
tsst
mon know it off i'm not gonna stand for th
tsst
seriously mom
tsst
seriusly why are you doing this
tsst
mom
tsst
mom mom
i did it
you see you're calm assertive and in control
oh oh my gosh
see this is the behavior we've been looking for this is a relaxed submissive state
he's never done this before
good now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention
i love you very much poopsiekins you're mommy's sunshine
now you can give him a snack  good this is really good now try a command
eric i want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth then i'll be up to read you a story before bed  oh my goodness i can't believe it
this is a great first step but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident you are the pack leader now
i am the pack leader
now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea
sounds divine
who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth  jesus what's happening to me
so how is your son doing ms cartman
oh he's been amazing cesar he got an a on his last spelling test and a b in history he's losing weight and he's doing what i tell him
that's greeat
the best part is i'm not letting him boss me around anymore i could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a saturday afternoon with a friend before
good ms cartman sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend
there's just one problem he still fights me every step of the way i feel like he's doing what i tell him but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child
don't worry when you correct the behavior eventually you will see a change in the personality
oh cesar i'm so happy to have you in my life
guys listen up i really need your help this time i've thought about it a lot and i've decided i have to kill my mom
kill your mom
she doesn't let me wear whatever i want anymore things have really gotten out of hand my mom must die so i can have a place to live but without her trying to run my life she's like hitler with all the demands she makes
dude have you lost more weight
yes i've lost almost ten pounds now you see what i mean i totally know how it felt to be a jew in the holocaust now i have to kill my mom it's my only way out
dude don't kill your mom that's not cool
she's hitler would you have killed hitler if you had the chance  all right now here's the plan at  tonight i will sneak out of my room and leave the house leaving the back door unlocked  you guys come into the house at  pm sharp having given me enough time to get down to perkins to be seen by everyone there and then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom
dude we're not killing your mom
well i can't kill her i'm too obvious a suspect now when you reach her room butters will keep a lookout while kenny opens the bedroom door kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head and stan shoots her in the face
where am i supposed to get a gun
well i don't know that's your job stan do i have to think of everything here
i'm not shooting anybody
okay fine butters you cover my mom's head with a pillow and kyle can shoot her in the face
no cartman
oh well how about i do everything how does that sound i'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games  fine i'll do it by myself
you forced me to do this you couldn't just love me as a son  you just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules i won't let you dominate my life anymore  goodbye mother
wait maybe i don't have the right to kill my mom
no she's my mom i can do whatever i want with her it's more important that i live the way i want
she isn't an object you can own she's a human being
she isn't an object i can own shshe's a human being
no she's just out to make you suffer

that sonofabitch
who is that guy
whoever he is he is one tough badass
world of warcraft support line
yeah we bought your game and played it online but every time we log in some other player comes in and kills us
oohhh that shouldn't happen we designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other
yeah well this guy does it anyway
he's a god damned butthole
really that's odd  more people calling in about their characters getting killed
oh no
well we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network  better tell the guys upstairs
fellow board members we have a problem somebody in the world of warcraft is ignoring the world's rulesand is going around killing innocent players
why kill innocent players the game is about finishing quests
we've got to delete him from the servers
we can't whoever this player is he has played world of warcraft so much that he has reached a level we thought unreachable he's actually able to kill our admins and he grows stronger every day
jesus
i've gotta get home my kids are playing world of warcraft right now
jim your kids' characters are already dead
no  no  they just started playing
what kind of person would do this

the pastfour nights we've tried to play he shows up and kills us
he killed my character right in the middle of a quest

we've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone but if we all log in together we might have a chance
hey yeah
we can really stick it to that assmmmuncher
are you guys dumb we can't beat him even with all of us it's a waste of time
ddue we have to try
i've got better things to do
clyde clyde  if you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop hitler wouldn't you do it  i mean i personally wouldn't stop him because i think he was awesome but you would right

over five thousand
there are over seven million people who log on to world of warcraft are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die and there's nothing we can do to save them
yes and it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether gentlemen this could very well lead to the end of the worldof warcraft
no nooooooooo
what the hell are you guys doing don't tell me you all quit playing world of warcraft too
dude we're done we're sick of getting killed all the time
guys when things look bad you can't just give up on the world of warcraft
we don't have a choice dude that guy killed our characters  times
i have a solution you guys that guy can kill us so easily because he's a superhigh level right what if we were superhigh level too
we can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests
that's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest killing boars
boars
there's lots of computergenerated boars in warcraft that die with just one blow
dude boars are only worth two experience points apiece do you know how many we would have to kill to get up  levels
yes  sixtyfive million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep what do you say guys you can justyou can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters

the admins tell us they are four players from a small town in colorado
are they strong enough to defeat the evil one
we ran the numbers even with their amazing rise in levels they have a  mortality probability they'd be walking in a slaughter
there has to besomeway we can help them
what aboutthe sword of a thousand truths
quiet thomas we aren't even to speak of that sword
but maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of
it is not an option
what is this sword
long ago when the world of warcraft was created one of the programmers put a sword called the sword of a thousand truths into the game inventory apparently it could cause  damage per second with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina
but the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess so it was removed from the game and stored on a onegig flash drive
but it was foretold that one day players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves
who foretold this prophecy
soltzman he's an accountant
behold the sword of a thousand truths  we must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life let's just hope to christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them
all right you guys the moment of truth is here it is time for our final battle everyone log in

i'm sorry mr mackey but there just isn't really any evidence to go on
but there must have been some motive nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason
but who would benefit from crapping in the urinal uh this is too big a mystery for me i think we'd better call in the hardly boys
the hardly boys two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries the hardly boys in  the mystery of the urinal turd
so that's it hardly boys we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime
that sure is a mystery
yeah it sounds superhard
whoever did it must have been angry with the school oh oooo i think i'm getting a clue
freally
yeah this is totally giving me a clue right now
oh i'm starting to get a clue too
my clue is kind of pointing this way
ohhgh yeah now i've got a total clue
i've still got a raging clue
my clue's pointing over there now
oh let's follow that clue
did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet
not yet
they aren't going to find out who did it but they'll make up a scapegoat send him to detention and make us all believe it it'll be  all over again
will you shut up about
kyle why are you so afraid of the truth
because anybody who thinks  was a conspiracy is a retard
oh really well did you know that over onefourth of people in america think that  was a conspiracy are you saying that onefourth of americans are retards
yes i'm saying onefourth of americans are retards
yeah at least onefourth
let's take a test sample there's four of us you're a retard that's onefourth
there are soo many people who know the truth kyle uh butters
hey fellas
butters do you think  was just a plot by some angry terrorists or do you think there was some kind of coverup
well i heard that  was caused by president bush
aha do you see
where did you hear that
from eric
i rest my case
butters you don't really believe that do you
well luh i mean uh you never know uh the government does some pretty spooky things the government and the corporations headed by the jews that tear down
that's right butters
goddamnit you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap fatass
what people see the truth
can i go now
you guys are blind i can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media  i'm gonna go find out the truth i'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole  conspiracy once and for all
oh no
it is wrong for me to ask questionsis it wrong to seek the truthi just can't blindly accept their versioni can't base my logic on proofalmost all the evidence points one waybut i'm like charlie sheen and gloria estefani need to know what really happenedon levenlevenlevenlevenwhat really happenedon of course it's so obvious how did we not see it before
this is my frog  he doesn't have a name he's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit i think frogs are good pets
okay thank you leroy thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class okay anybody else have anything for show and tell
uh erh eh uhhh
all right eric you can go next
for show and tell today i have brought  my shocking powerpoint report on the truth  behind the  attacks
oh christ
we are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers  which led to their collapse but did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel  we were told the pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well  but now look at this photo of the pentagon the hole is not nearly big enough and if a plane hit it where is the rest of the plane
whoa
so now the inevitable question if terrorists didn't cause  who did  remember that there are in fact two towers two minus one is one one one   two minus one is one one one and there are nine members on silverstein's board of directors that's nineoneone nineeleven and take      and you get  which leads us all to the mastermind of the  attacks  kyle
me
twelve contains the numbers one and two just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one and one and two with  and you get  drop the  and it's  exactly the score kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after  who has the most to gain from  kyle who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell kyle who dropped the deuce in the urinal kyle but probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of tower   when i zoomed in i saw what first appeared to be a blur  but when i computerenhanced it  you almost got away with it you sneaky butthole
hey token  youyou gonna watch the game tonight butters
waaaah
all right all right i was not responsible for   goddamnit
hello bubbe how was school today
terrible
oh come on school isn't all that bad
but everyone thinks i was responsible for
whatwhatwhaaat
we have to do something it is obvious our children are still completely confused about
yes we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened
well what really happened there's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth
oh no oh brother oh god
that's right did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers
oh no oh god that's so retarded
look whatever you believe the fact of the matter is somebody dropped a dookie in the school urinal and there's still no explanation for that
mr mackey there are more important things going on here
more important you aren't the one who had to walk into the boys' bathroom okay after having tuh to wake up early you know there's no no coffee in the teachers' lounge and then you you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal like it's laughin' at you
he's right the turd could have been put there to cover up
no i'm not saying they're related
how do we know they're not we need to be brave enough to ask questions
it's obvious that before we go any further we need to find out who was behind  once and for all
who else could it have been
this is too big a mystery for me i think we'd better call in the hardly boys
oh no not the goddamned
the hardly boys two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries the hardly boys in  the case of the world trade center conspiracy
so that's about the long and short of it hardly boys there were two towers that stood right here  and they're gone
and nobody knows who's responsible
there are theories but nobody's certain
nnnn who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing
ooo oh i just started getting a clue
really
yeah i'm totally getting a clue
oh oh that's giving me a clue yeah yeyeah i've got a raging clue right now
mine's pointing to the left
oh f oh frank seriously i have such a raging clue right now i think we'd better follow it
okay let's follow your raging clue
oofff
godspeed
kyle
aaaah
dude do you mind telling me why cia guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you
i don't know dude it's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there
well why did you have to involve me
it's not my fault
all right look i've been doing a lot of research on the web and i found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in
really
come on we'll go out the back so they don't see you  there's just one thing i need to know before we go you weren't responsible for  right
dude
that's all i needed
now you might all think i've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal m'kay and maybe maybe you think it's a victimless crime this is mr venezuela  the school janitor okay  he's the person who has to clean up when some trickster drops a dook in the wrong toilet mr venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best okay he's got three kids at home he's got a car that barely works he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust m'kay then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face  so when you crapped in that urinal m'kay you might as well have just dropped your pants and laid a turd right on top of mr venezuela's head  oh you think it's funny huh
mr mackey  we got him
huh
we caught the person that did it
hi we were hoping you can help us my friend is being blamed for
aw geez come on in kids  it doesn't surprise me more and more people are being blamed for  every day
they are
what no no no
dude why would the government attack its own buildings
that's retarded
there's a lot of holes in the theory of evolution too it doesn't mean it's wrong
code
what is it
anthrax
stan we can't be seen with this nutjob  aw aw awww
why clyde why did you do it
i don't know
you got a whole school here clyde m'kay you got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room  then you decide you're gonna be a comedian m'kay and pinch one off in the urinal and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at  okay okay you think it's funny but nobody else does they gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll
mr mackey clyde's parents are here
m'kay that's good  let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade  come on in please i'm just trying to get your son to explain why he would drop a dook in the urinal
mr mackey there's something you should know
ehxcuse me there's been a misunderstanding
come on in mr president
uh mr president my name is
sshhuudduupp you think we don't know your name we know everything we control everything  we've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in  a secret but you just had to keep digging
really
people you mean sheeple we have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance just one more leak  to fix
you've been a thorn in our side for too long i'm afraid
too late
jesus christ
hahaha he died like a pig
some pigs never learn
no way
he was right you did cause
yes quite simple to pull off really all i had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers then on  we pretended like four planes were being hijackedwhen really we just rerouted them to pennsylvania then flew two military jets into the world trade center filled with more explosives then shot down all the witnesses of flight  with an f after blowing up the pentagon with a cruise missile it was only the world's most intricate and flawlesslyexecuted ever ever
really
why
oldest reason in the world money the towers fell and the american sheeple all waved their flags  finally we could invade iraq  and get the oil which made us all richer than before
beauutiful money hahahaha
really
is the whole government in on this
we are allknowing and allpowerful goodbye boys
dangit i missed again
for christ's sake cheney
kyle run
kill them
attention students apparently clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal because clyde had a colostomy at age  'kay now whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large the boys' bathroom is closed until further notice 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea to pull down your pants m'kay hover your buttcheeks over the urinal and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog m'kay  oh you think that's funny huh  let me assure you there is nothing funny about going up to a nice clean unsuspectin' urinal  'kay droppin' your pants then turnin' around squattin' over that urinal 'kay maybe maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands m'kay and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see  oh yeah that's real funny  i'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing i do m'kay
all right now we have to switch over to interbus  we made it dude  we should be home in less than eighteen hours then we'll tell everyone what we saw
it just doesn't seem right
yeah our eyes are finally open dude it's like waking up for the first time
yeah but doesn't it seem like we got out of the white house pretty easily i mean it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the white house with everyone chasing you and we just kind of ran out
well dude maybe we're just super badass have you thought of that
hey  dude you're alive  come back here
hey
ogh
dude what the hell is going on
what who said
dude we aren't going to kill you
oh god
it isn't safe here boys follow me
who the fuck are you
there's no time come on
do you mind telling us what the hell is going on
who are you
i'm a detective and i'm afraid that you kids have been doublecrossed
you ffigured this thing all out
not me my mysterysolving sons come on in boys  my boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd which gave them a clue
gave us both a clue
that clue led them to a  conspiracy group party where they got a lot more clues
i was getting a clue like every two minutes
i got such a raging clue that i almost shot clue goo all over joe
those clues pointed out that all the  conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically and that's when frank got his biggest clue
it was huuuge
that all the  conspiracy web sites are run by the government the  conspiracy is a government conspiracy
aw jesus
why would the government want people to believe they caused
for a government to have power they must appear to have complete control what better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth
that's quite enough hardly  don't believe what he says boys we caused   it's all right here in these secret documents  but you'll never get them
i knew it you didn't plan  and you really didn't shoot that guy
boys you don't understand people need to think we are allpowerful that we control the world if they know we weren't in charge of  then we appear to control nothing
well why don't you just tell people the truth
we do that too and most people believe the truth but one fourth of the population is retarded if they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans why not let them
just one thing mr president how the devil did you know we were all here
how come you couldn't just go home dude that's all we had to do
stan what the fuck
it was all planned out
you knew this whole time why
because it was me i'm the one who took a dump in the urinal
what
the stalls were full and i didn't wanna miss recess i didn't think it would turn into such a big deal
so you blamed the government
and the government was more than willing to take the blame so long as it made them look responsible for
oh man now everyone's gonna know why did the stupid hardly boys have to be so good at solving mysteries
so wait wait stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy web site but the conspiracy site was run by the government
yuh
so then who was responsible for
whattaya mean a bunch of pissedoff muslims
yeah what are you retarded
well it looks like this mystery is solved it's time for the culprit to finally pay
when you dook in the urinal it's bad m'kay  how would you feel if somebody came into your home m'kay pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face  oh you think that's funny huh yeah that's real funny
and so then i put my finger up my butthole right and i walked up to kelly nelson and i said do you smell lemon grass and she smelled my finger and puked hehehehe oh guys you should have been there
eric i have to take you to the principal's office
what i didn't do it kelly nelson's a liar
i've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office

eric cartman report to the principal's office immediately
aw goddamnit
come on in eric
i'm sorry principal victoria i didn't mean to do it how could i have been so foolish
eric the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor

i hope for your sake that's true you've never thrown a party of this magnitude before satan be wary
halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness but now it appears that satan will literally be among us he is bringing hell here to los angeles and from what we understand the gathering is going to be completely off the hook  there's more none of us are invited
none
satan mocks us
his party must be stopped
yes we cannot let evil take over our city even for a night
what can we do
tomorrow night after all of satan's guests have arrived we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there we'll see how long satan's party lasts after the fire marshal shows up

there you are eric what are you doing here
i'm waiting for the new nintendo wii to come out
when does it come out
three weeks come ohhhn ccome ohhhn
it's time for school
no mom you don't understand i've been waiting for this thing to come out for months and now every day time is slowing down it's like waiting for christmas times a thousand
eric you're just going to have to be patient
noo nooo
principal victoria it is wrong  it is wrong and i simply will not do it  i care about my students and i will not fill their heads with lies  i am not teaching evolution in my class
mrs garrison evolution is in the school curriculum we have to teach it
evolution is a theory a harebrained theory that says i'm a monkey i am not a monkey i'm a woman
m m'kay yayou realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh proven
i warn you principal victoria those students are not prepared to hear this stuff
our students want to learn mrs garrison and they're mature enough to handle anything
how long until nintendo wii comes out now
it's still three weeks
oh god  okay how long now
will you shut up already
all right kids it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution
oh boy
now i for one think evolution is a bunch of bull crap but i've been told i have to teach it anyway it was thought up by charles darwin and it goes something like this  in the beginning we were all fish okay swimming around in the water and then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby and the retard baby was different so it got to live so retard fish goes on to make more retard babies and then one day a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its  mutant fish hands and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this  retard frog squirrel and then that had a retard baby which was a monkey fishfrog and then this monkey fishfrog had butt sex with that monkey and that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and that made you  so there you go you're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fishsquirrel congratulations
hehhh i can't take it anymore haaaaah
yeah you see i knew that would happen
come ohhhn ccome ohhhn
look kid for the fortieth time pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the wii come any faster
eric you're coming home right now
can't i just stay and look at the sign a little longer
it's almost bedtime if you sleep then time'll go by faster
oh god
agh that does it i am not waiting three weeks
you guys you guys you guys you gotta help me
dude you don't look so good cartman
i can't take it anymore you guys the wait for nintendo wii is literally killing me
well there's nothing you can do so you just have to be patient
no there is something i can do
what
all right listen you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short right  i think i figured out how to do it
do what
freeze myself if i freeze myself then in three weeks when nintendo wii comes out you guys can unfreeze me the wait will seem instantaneous to me
no
it's simple science kyle
you'll die retard
i'll die waiting for the wii to come out don't you see this is my only chance
dude no way
yeah i hate you but i'm not going to help kill you
i thought you were my friends i guess i was wrong after everything we've been through together you guys won't even help me freeze myself
principal victoria we are a devout catholic family do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fishfrog
i told you this would happen didn't i
mr triscotti i wasn't aware that
we have worked years to instill the teachings of jesus christ into our daughter and in one fell swoop you try to destroy everything we did
i hear ya
sir if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution then we can pull her out of class
you most certainly will
but dad i want to learn everything
no you don't shut up
well i told you we should leave evolution out of the classrooms
it has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it i'm having you replaced mr dawkins
rereplaced
richard dawkins is a worldrenowned evolutionary scientist
charmed to meet you ms
shut up faggot principal victoria i can teach my own class
you are to sit in class and help mr dawkins with whatever he needs
over billions of years life has evolved from simple onecelled organisms into all the complex life we see around us
whatever
it was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air
retarded fishfrogs
ms garrision i believe that's a gross oversimplification
well you're a faggot  continue
you see children life has the amazing ability to change to adapt like changing us to the point that we walk upright
so you are saying that we're all related to monkeys
well yes basically we are
do you see monkeys at the zoo they crap in their hands and throw it at people
ms garrison this isn't theory it is scientific fact
what about the fact that if i believe in this crap you're gonna go to hell doesn't that bother you a little
actually no because i'm an atheist
aha i've got you you snake in the grass i found you out
i never covered it up
and if i'm a monkey then i might as well act like a monkey huh
what on earth are you doing
don't ask me i'm a fuckin' monkey
aaah
principal victoria i was simply trying to make a point to mr dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements
mrs garrison i am pulling you out of the classroom
what
principal victoria i really don't think that's necessary this woman is very opinionated but she does care about her students
very well but there is to be no more throwing of feces understood
ms garrison ms garrison could i have a word with you please
what
look i know you think we're at war but i want you to know i admire your passion
you dyou do
i've never met a woman with so much fire
well i  i do bring down a woman's wrath now and again
so much boldness in a woman so beautiful  i'm sorry i'm sure you have a husband but i
no nno my my husband is ggone dead
would you then consider having dinner with me tonight
well  well i suppose we could have a little steak or something
i've got a date i've got a date my first real date with a real man since my sexchange operation  oh boy what'll i wear  hey everybody
ey
whoa
close the door i'm trying to freeze
eric get out of there
no no it's too soon
now eric this has gone far enough  you need to learn to be patient
butters get your coat we gotta go
go where
you're gonna help me freeze myself
okay
well how come we've gotta come all the way out here
butters if anyone else comes upon my frozen body they'll try to unfreeze me right away  i have to be hidden  that's good  and no matter what happens butters you are not to unfreeze me until the day the nintendo wii comes out do you got it
eric are you sure this is a good idea
no it's not a good idea it's an awesome idea
yeahi guess it is
all right you got the spot figured out you're not gonna lose where i am right
i got it  big tree oval rock
all right now get out of here you can't freeze too or else we're both screwed  get out of here you asshole you're gonna ruin everything
oh jeez
yes come on freeeze freeeze
so i told my gynecologist you put so many things in my vagina maybe i should charge you
oh ms garrison you are the most outspoken woman i have ever met it's almost like you're one of the guys
hehyeah almost
you have so much spunk so much life if only you were an atheist
well well you know i'm i'm open to stuff
why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole god thing
oh i'm not i'm not totally into the whole god thing i just i just think you know you can't disprove god
well what if i told you there was a flying spaghetti monster would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven
you're riiight it's so simple god is a spaghetti monster oh thank you jeez my eyes are opened  hey everyone i'm an atheist
really oh that's wonderful
no i totally get it now evolution explains everything there is no great mystery to life just evolution and god's a spaghetti monster thank you richard
you're so welcome
would you like tuh  head over to my place for dessert
oh yeah yeah i'm a monkey give this monkey what she wants
oh ms garrison

that's right kids and so you see there is no god
careful darling the school board doesn't like it when we

ms garrison i'm not so sure what you did in class today was right
what but dick you told me the world would be a better place without religion
yes but to be so bold about it  i've just never seen a woman with such balls
you've just been too soft on religious people in the past think about it richard with your intellect and my balls we can change the future of the world
can you imagine a world with no religion no muslims killing jews no christians bombing abortion clinics the world would be a wonderful place without god

it's rumored that there's one at the museum of technology at new new hampshire
so i'm not too late come on let's go
well there's just ththere's something we need from you first
you see my young friend you were unfrozen for a reason
lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them but you are special
i know i'm special this isn't news to me
you lived in a time when a great event happened a glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete now the entire world is atheist
and this gives me a nintendo wii how
we believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group the unified atheist league
who
what in science's name was that
oh no it's the united atheist alliance
oh science help us
science damn you unified atheist league
who are they
the alliance atheists we're at war with them
no
jesus christ
hahahaha you believe in a supernatural being  oh my science
i'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play nintendo wii
put me through to the allied atheist allegiance
onscreen
look allied atheist allegiance we have the time child
science damn you united atheist alliance
now you see foolish sea otters that we are the atheists in control
it won't make a difference this is the dawning of the sea otter know this time child i shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy
what
otters the time has come sound the nafferty
the nafferty
so it begins
the year is  and young eric cartman cannot wait for the new nintendo wii to come out unable to cope with the wait any longer eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks but a freak avalanche makes eric impossible to find and so he remains frozen for  years
whoa steady  this way otters
this is it new new hampshire we have risked much bringing you here time child
can it you otters may have evolved to the point you can talk but i don't need lectures
don't let the time child out of your sight he could try to run
we have a deal blavius as long as i get what i want you have nothin' to worry abuot
something is spooking the ostriches
sure this is monarch land now probably jarvis probes everywhere
here it is we have arrived
hold  this is it time child  the old museum of technology abandoned long ago let's get what you want time child and get out of here
over here  yeah it's here it's here the nintendo wii i've waited so long for this
all right time child we've filled our side of the bargain now return with us to otter bay
sorry blavius i've got other plans
noooo
it was a trick
science damn you time child
i got it i got the wii
time child you've returned
we thought for sure you had died in the in the phobart plant
yeah lucky for me the otters believed i was on their side  do me a favor next time i'm in a recessed biocave don't send me a level  homing call
tc wait
oh i can't wait this is gonna be so awesome  get out of my way
you gained the otters' trust were you wearing an information crystal
here
science be praised this could end the war
you've done a great thing tc  how can we repay you
just send a maintenance guy to my room i want this nintendo hooked up to my float screen now
come on come on dude what is taking so long i wanna play
uhh what kind of output does this have this is some ancient supervhs output or somethin' i can't connect it to your flaot screen
there's gotta be some way to hook it up it's the freakin' future
it may be the future for you but i can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser output
you've gotta be shittin' me sciencedamnit i am so fucking sick of the future
tc what's wrong
i'll tell you what's wrong i've been waiting  years to play the nintendo wii and if i don't get to play real soon i'm gonna bust a nut
well we're all glad you're back i know somebody who's missed you very much come on in k
bark bark hello eric i have missed you
suck my balls k i'm not in the mood
fellow atheists the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies the allied atheist alliance they have started digging for clams in sector j if we mount an allout attack we can wipe out their food supply
but those are civilian otters
we cannot tolerate the otters their science is flawed their answer to the great question is different from ours
yes but sending out all our ships at the same time it would leave our city exposed
that's why we have to be superduper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it
the united atheist alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the allied atheist allieance's clam fields
praise science this is your chance young shvek to avenge your father's death
careful son just because their science leads them to a different answer to the great question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all
no our answer to the great question is the only logical one our science is great  let us not forget the great richard dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago  dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future  but it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough you have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you  prepare all the troops we will level the united atheist alliance to the ground
with new glade monvert cleaner you can make your monvert sparkle like never before
my monvert's never looked so clean
god i hate future tv there's too many commercials

the united atheist alliance has taken the bait soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields and while their ships are away the united atheist league intends to attack them our plan has worked perfectly for when the united atheist league attacks the united atheist alliance we will charge in and kill them all our science our answer to the great question shall prevail
hail science hail science hail science
and i will personally kill the time child and eat his entrails on my tummy

science reason is that really all there is
they are not a logical race wise one they go around chopping down trees for tables when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on how logical is that
yes  the great dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason how reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy
well perhaps the great dawkins wasn't so wise oh he was intelligent but some of the most intelligent otters i've ever known were completely lacking in common sense maybe some otters do need to believe in something who knows maybe just believing in god makes god exist
kill the wise one
kill the wise one

and that's the end of the game the result is a tie
tie well what does that mean
stan marsh was supposed to win it all the big game a dying boy's hope only problem is  he tied  and now he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning
hello
coach
how are you feeling
i feel pretty good except for the cancer  coach does god hate me
oh hello coach
uh hi doc how's he doing
well he isn't worse but he isn't getting better it's almost as if his cancer were tied
oh boy
oh my cancer hurts
he seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game and with a tie he's in a kind of cancer limbo
but what can i do
stan marsh stan marsh great news our hockey team has just been invited to play against denver county during a colorado avalanche game
wow  at the pepsi center
look he's coming around again
that's our biggest game ever do you think we can win coach
well ah i mean
imagine if there was one game one chance to make everything right stan marsh is being given that chance but to win he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in stanley's cup rated r
yeah yeah we'll beat 'em
all right maybe there is hope for me
just be aware of this coach if you lose the big game that little boy is going to die faster than steve irwin in a tank full of stingrays
well sure we can
look guys i believe in you nelson believes in you doesn't that count for anything
they're not gonna kill us
haven't you guys ever seen these movies we're just supposed to rally together believe in ourselves and we win in the end
hey that's right we need a ringer
yeah
stan i told you my mom doesn't want ike playing hockey she thinks it's dangerous
it's just for one game he won't get hurt i promise
yeah
all right but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions stan you'd better have a really good game plan
can you believe it stan the pepsi center you're going back to the place where it all happened same place where you missed that shot all those years ago
dad i'm working on my game plan right now
ya have to understand why i can't go i can't sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again  oh stan of all the places why does it have to be the pepsi center all right all right i'll go no no i want to go  i'm gonna be there for you and i'll be rooting louder than anybody saying that's my son  and just remember stan win or lose those are your two options win or lose
his shot is blocked what a great save  and that's the end of the second period the score is tied all  and now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest pee wee hockey players
all right you guys this is it the moment is here we've been through a lot together and according to every movie ever made we're going to win this game just don't forget there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us so let's not let him down are you with me  all right let's go win

uh it might be best if you just let it go m'kay
you don't understand  you see words are like bullets and if you take away the gunpowder
yeah yeah we we get it mr nelson
very well mr nelson  stacey go ahead and send in eric cartman  eric mr nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people
oh did i hurt his little feelings
you know you think you have the power to make me insecure but your words are actually completely powerless
oh oh oh oh if we could get like eight of these we could dress them all up like little beavers right and then put 'em in a pond and see if they build a dam
you see no matter what you say i'm still standing
barely
no matter how you act i can rise above it
rise above it get it like he can rise above anything

and so it is my honor to announce today the randy marsh africanamerican scholarship foundation  it is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of africanamerican students and erase once and for all my identity as the nigger guy  you really you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past i mean i just wanna move on from what happened on wheel of fortune you know and and when people call me nigger guy they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it you just you can't imagine how that feels
is this nigger guy serious

yeah you like making fun of minorities nigger guy huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance
you tell 'im skeeter you tell 'im
what do you want
what do we want  we want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of africanamericans
leave him alone
hey that's that other nigger guy
huh
that's the guy from seinfeld used the nword a whole bunch o' times
michael richards huh well son of a bitch
looks like it's our lucky day we done got us two nigger guys

mark fuhrman
who
he done said the nword in the oj case
well what is this a nigger guy convention
we aren't being pushed around anymore leave
come on skeeter  these nigger guys ain't worth our trouble
damn nigger guys  we'll be back
you'd better come with us
come on in mr marsh we'll make you some coffee
what's going on here
we've been following your story since we first saw it on the news don't worry  you're with friends now dale here used the nword in a racial joke at work scott used the plural nword to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence
they were mexicans i was being ironic
we're all just like you
no  no no i'm sorry but i'm not like you i just said the nword by mistake to win money
i made a mistake too  i was trying to be funny i got frustrated and thought i would get some shock laughs i'm just not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth
you said the nword to a black man's face that's way worse than what i did
you really think that matters  you really think all those people out there see a difference oh they might say your racial slur was more accidental they might even laugh about it but at the end of the day all you are to them is just another damned nigger guy  oh you don't like that do ya
no
randy we want you to join us we have a plan to make this all go away once and for all
now look token i've done everything i can to make this right you have no reason to still be mad
i have every reason to be mad you just don't get it
i'm not responsible for what my dad did
no but you can't just pretend it never happened either
what the hell do you want from me
nothing
then stop being mad
no
fellas fellas come quick cartman's gonna fight the midget
all right eric come on eric
dude are you sure you wanna do this apparently this guy has a black belt in karate
it's a midget dude
students i am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point
hahaha no dude it can't talk that isn't fair i'll laugh too much
senators i know it is not normally considered american to ban words  but there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal i'm talking of course about the term nigger guy
nigger guy
two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together form a verbal missile of hate
yeah that's right
oh sure some people just use the term in jest  tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal  but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence
goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all politicallike now
senators i've learned to admit that i'm capable of having slightly racist thoughts once in a while can anybody say they never do how long will it be before you are all called nigger guys
uhhh hold on a second are you suggesting that nigger guy could become a slur that refers to all white people
i'm certainly not a nigger guy i've never thought a racist thought
aw come on you're the biggest nigger guy in washington
mr marsh we see now the importance of your bill  all those in favor to ban the term nigger guy
aye
opposed
nay
the motion is passed
we did it
for the first time in american history a word has been officially banned from use
from now on if a person uses the word nigger it must be at least seven words away from the word guy
tom it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove  oh dammit i said it didn't i
aaaa ow ow okay  okay you win
say uncle
ungcle
hahaha now say caroline don't go into the light
caroline don't go into the light
haaha hahahahahaha oh man that is hysterical  oh

wait a minute that's it i don't get it
huh
don't you see kyle i don't get it  token i get it now i don't get it i've been trying to say that i understand how you feel but i'll never understand i'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the n word i don't get it

butters
whoa hey eric
butters guess what i have a surprise for you

butters
uh
whoa hey dad
butters what are you doing
i'm getting a surprise
oh my god my my only son reduced to this
hey where'd eric go
butters how long have you been doing stuff like this
like what
don't lie to me butters i know your secret now no wait wait it's okay it's okay butters this isn't a serious problem you're just bicurious
what's bicurious
you are just harmless curiosity and it doesn't mean anything we just need to get you some help butters
what's going on you two
nothin' mom i'm just a little bicurious
father maxi i just don't know where else to turn you see i've just learned that my son is bicurious
is that true son are you feeling confused
yeah i'm pretty confused alright
you see
young man these confused feelings that you're having are simply the devil's way of trying to get a hold of you
really
what can i do father
there is a special camp where young men who are confused like your son can go and be cleansed by the power of god many bicurious boys come out the camp completely cured
a secluded camp where lots of bicurious boys are all put together that sounds like a good idea
whoa boy camp
haahaahahaha  very funny i suppose you really think you got me
what are you talking about fatass
i checked on the internet kyyyle and getting butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said
you figured that out huh
that's right and i also learned from the internet that just because i put butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean i'm gay all i have to do is throw away the picture forget it ever happened and nobody will ever know
except for us
right except for you
and all the people we tell
why would you tell anybody
because it's really really funny
it's not that funny there's lots there's lots of things that are way funnier
like what
liiike a tampon in the school cafeteria in in somebody's lunch  liiike a a dog crap on on a guy's face
that isn't funny
yes it is now you guys i'm getting pissed off you'd better not tell anybody
well maybe we will maybe we won't
fine whatever you guys don't have any proof i put butters' wiener in my mouth it will be your word against mine and we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys  you guys please don't tell anybody
okay we won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us every day from now on
oh right like that's possible alright fine you know what i'm gonna do kyle i'm gonna go home and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with butters' wiener in his mouth here and if any of you say anything to anybody i'll simply show them the picture of kyle  haha hahahaha
everyone say hello to our new camper butters
hi butters hello hi hello butters
thank you so much for taking him in
don't worry your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be
do you know why you're here at camp butters
because i'm bicurious
that's right like all the campers here you're confused and you don't think there's a way out but even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel the truth is that with the power of jesus christ you can be normal now just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy  let's meet ryan your accountabilibuddy  ryan thought he could never change but now he's learning that with the power of christ and prayer he can have a whole new life  over this way we have the cafeteria all the meals are served there  uh bradley how about you be butters' accountabilibuddy
humble yourselves therefore under god's might hand that he may lift you up  peter
butters here is new to the camp he's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with jesus christ
i'm bicurious
do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman that is detestable  leviticus
that's right bradley i think we're well on our way to being healed  we've got another one room
aw darnit
aw man i've got h o r s now
okay my turn
where is it you filthy jew
where's what
you know god damned well what
let go of me
what the hell are you doing cartman
i went home to alter the picture of me with butters' penis in my mouth to look like kyle but it was gone  what did you do with my picture
knock it off i don't have your stupid picture
give it back kyle
i don't have it
i swear to god kyle if you don't give it back right now  i'm gonna break your fuckin' jew legs right here
shut up
you shut up you're lying and  you two are covering up for him you know what you're just like jews yourselves stan you're a jew and kenny you're a jew you're all jews  ow  ow aaaauh  nyaaaaaaaaaa
the lord is love this forwith jesus i can just say noand not be confused anymore
we will now hear a sermon from pastor phillips for those of you who are new to camp pastor phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you
he's bicurious too
not anymore because pastor phillips prayed and by the hand of jesus christ he's now completely cured let's hear it for pastor phillips kids
helloooo campers  yeth believe it or not i mythelf used to have unclean urges and like a lot of you i thought i was just made that way that i didn't have a choice but then i realized that god didn't want me to be that way god wanted me to be a man  so i buckled up in my little suit and i prayed to be normal and guess what  it worrrrked
that's right kids you see right now you're like a paper clip  and just like a paper clip  god needs to bend you and shape you and make youuuu straight
so you say you were robbed
yes a photograph and i know who took it his name is kyle broflovski
if it's a photo what's the big deal why don't you just print out another one
it's a big deal okay that picture is my propertih and i want it back
okay what is the picture of
why why does that matter
well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is
all right it's a picture of me
yes
it's a picture of me  and um what appears to be a penis in my mouth
you were sucking somebody's penis
no no i was not i was asleep and this person just puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing and and took the picture
i see
yes now it may appear in the picture that i'm actually looking at the camera lens and sand smiling with the penis in my mouth and giving a thumbs up but i assure you i was fast asleep
well we'd have to get a warrant first approved by a grand jury
i don't have time for that we have school tomorrow and i know that kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during show and tell
well then you're screwed
you both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell
well sure i guess
only through christ can we cleanse our souls
and you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye
well yeah sure
so let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean  corinthians chapter
then do you mind telling us why we found this   sears men's underwear catalog in your room
that's that's mine
you know this is strictly forbidden
ah i don't understand what's wrong with underwear
what's wrong  this is what makes you confused don't you get it this is confusing you right now isn't it
yes it's all very confusing
this is just as much your fault butters bradley is your accountabilibuddy that makes you accountabilibuddyable both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids  right for having contraband in your room you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days
that son of a bitch he's gonna show everyone that picture only twelve hours from now  that's it i don't have a choice i'm gonna have to bring mom in on this one i'm just going to have to tell her the truth  ow ow ow
eric what's the what's the matter
i don't want to go to school tomorrow
sweetie shhh tell mommy what happened
kyle has a picture of me and he's gonna show everyone during show and tell and everyone's gonna laugh at meeee
oh now why would he do that
because he's jealous of how much smarter i am than him so he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre
what is the picture of eric
last time when butters spent the night i was being really nice to him and i was gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have
ohh that's nice
but then right when i took the picture butters got really hot so he pulled his pajama bottoms down and then i tripped and fell down and my mouth landed right on his penis and then i thought of something funny so i smiled up at the camera and gave like a thumbs up and and then kyle took the picture from me and he's gonna show it to everybody and make them think i'm gaaaaaaay
oh there there sweetie it'll be okay these things happen
but mom i've been trying to get the picture back but he won't give it to meee
it's okay eric i'll have a talk with kyle's mother
you you will
but that he loved us and sent his only son to be the satisfaction of our sins neato
butters i'm sorry for getting you into trouble
awww that's okay bradley
i really want to get better i try to do everything the counselors say but somehow i still feel confused
yeah well hopefully when we finish writin' all these verses we won't be bicurious no more and then we can go home
you're really terrific butters i mean i think you're great  oh oh oh god bad thought bad thought
wuhwhat's the matter
i think i i th i think i like you
well i like you too bradley
you do
well yeah
you like like me
sure i like like you a lot a lot
oh god we're both unfixable don't you see we're lost causes we're just evil and nothing can change us there's no other way out butters we have to kill ourselves
no bradley you can't leave you're my accountabilibuddy
hello
hello sheila it's liane eric's mother
ohh hello mrs cartman
um sheila i'm sorry to trouble you with this but apparently your son has a picture of eric with another boy's penis in his mouth
excuse me
don't worry sweetie everything is fine
it is  really oh mommy thank you thank you
you have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow mrs broflovski assured me that kyle doesn't have the picture
what
she talked with her son and says he doesn't have it
mom she's lying
she said she was sure eric
mom you don't know anything about jews they lie all the time
well eric there's nothing more i can do about it
then that's it kyle wins but he won't win completely i'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself i can at least rob kyle of his final lie
do you mind telling me how you managed to lose your accountabilibuddy
i went looking for 'im but he runs real fast
you don't seem to take this camp seriously butters i've called your father in for a talk
oh no my dad
do you understand the concept of hell do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity
well yeah but i just don't quite understand what you're fixin'
we're fixing your confusion
there you are butters
oheh hey dad
what's he done now
mr stotch your son is insubordinate unwilling to change and worse yet he's lost his accountabilibuddy
they found him they found bradley you'd better come quick
oh lord in heaven don't jump bradley
staystay back i'm an abomination of god
nono we're fixing you
guess you think today is your big day huh kyle to embarrass me in front of everyone  well guess what i'm not giving you the satisfaction
okay students let's all take our seats since it is monday we'll start as always with show and tell  who'd like to go first
ow quit it dude
okay eric jesus calm down you can go first
ha  for show and tell today i would like to share with you some very special very artsy photographs i've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer  this first picture i like to call moods of winter  a simple aspen grove shot in highcontrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one of death this picture i took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work a statement about all of our loneliness perhaps
he isn't actually going to show everyone
and now this next picture
don't jump bradley you will only make god angrier with you
it's too late
bradley please you're my accountabilibuddy how will this make me look
you get back you're only gonna make things worse
i'm not normal i'll never be normal
you're perfectly normal bradley
get back you're just as confused as he is
all right all right that does it  i am sick and tired of everyone telling me i'm confused i wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me i was  you know what i think i think maybe you are the ones who are confused
yeah
i'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say i should be my name is butters i'm eight years old i'm blood type o and i'm bicurious and even that's okay because if i'm bicurious and i'm somehow made from god then i think your god must be a little bicurious himself
i think i think i'd like to come down now
he's coming down  we did it  through the power of christ we have saved this child
well butters i guess we might as well go home looks like you're never gonna change
no i like bein' bicurious
well you know somethin' so do i
wait now i am confused
and this photograph i took of a sunset near the power plant note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the earth which brings us to my last picture ahem this picture you may find somewhat controversial
eww
dude
yes this is shot at a  aperture using a lowlight filter you can see the grain from the highspeed film  there's sort of a penis in my mouth right here  and the low depth of field keeps the background soft
eric what the hell is this
what this is is a statement against the war in iraq it's wrong that we still have our troops there it's wrong and what i think that
uh eric cartman we got an emergency message from your mother  do not show picture kyle didn't have it after all found it under your desk she said you'd know what that means m'kay
lame
all right students let's take our seats apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about
ah yes you mean the jew problem  good good i'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it
no i mean the problem of head lice  there's been a lice breakout at a school in denver and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here
somebody might have lice
ewww
so today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined
uh ththat is completely unnecessary everyone knows that only poor people can get lice the only person that can spread it here is kenny
what fuck you
i'm sure this class is clean but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice we can stop it before it spreads  lice can live in anybody's hair
hello kelly how's my babih
you mean me or the little one
i mean both
well besides a little loneliness waiting for daddy to come home i guess we're both okay
how did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you
luck had nothing to do with it travis  you okay
sometimes i just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in  i need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis i'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer
all students make sure you're in line according to your grade when you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked
boy i sure hope they don't find lice in my hair
what do you think happens if you do have it
they drag you out of here put you in this big containment facility where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly and then they shock your balls
i'm clean i knew i didn't have any stupid lice
this is ridiculous all this just so they can send kenny and his stupid head lice home
hey fuck off
have a seat on the stool
uh oh looks like you've got 'em
what
you have lice let's see clyde harris is it
oh my god oh christ no
now now it's all right we're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor
please yayou don't understand the other kids are gonna make fun of me forever
i'm sure your friends aren't that cruel
yes they are
mr president mr president i believe we have a serious problem  the environment is changing i believe it is somehow reacting to our presence on it
and what do you base this on
look this is the world right but now think of the world as a living being  if it were somehow conscious then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it
huh right the world is conscious it makes perfect sense  hello anybody
if we have made too much of an impact then that consciousness would try to snuff us out i think we're looking at a global catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen
poodiggery and poppycock
i think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation
evacuation tomorrow is the gootack festival do you know how much money we would lose escort mr mayfield out the president can't be bothered any further
damn you vice president craig you could be killin' us all
this is so embarrassing
i have an ear infection what are you seeing the doctor for
i have i have aids
clyde harris
yeeaahh that's a pretty bad lice problem there good thing they pulled you out of school
but why me doctor why me how did i get this
well believe it or not some lice can actually attach themselves to flies and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce and then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there
sick
this shampoo should take care of it  use this in the shower your scalp may burn a bit afterwards but it should kill every last one of them
travis everything okay
kelly i was just thinkin' about our babih i want to name her hope
hope
hope for a chance at tomorrow
it's raining now
woohoo i love the rain
oh my god  we have to get out of here
what it it's just rain
we have to get out of here now kellih
what is that
whoa  ruuun
everyone get up into the trees we have to get up high come on kelly
my god travis they're all dying
don't look kelly don't look
what the hell is it
well it's okay we're safe up here
i don't think so
ooohooooooh
travis
kellih hang on
i can't hang on
you have to for the babih
nooooooooooo
kehhhllihhhh no noooo
okay kids today we're going to review some civil war history who can tell me what year the war started
waiwaiwait whoa whoa so what happened
with what
with the lice exam did they find anybody with lice
yyes some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken
somebody in this class
uh yes
ohhhhh
well who was it  it was kenny right
that doesn't matter it's over
doesn't matter if somebody had parasites in their hair we need to know who  it was kenny wasn't it
i wanna know who it was too
it's being kept confidential there's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice because of the embarrassment it can cause okay
that is bullcrap you are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast
yeah
and we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them
how do we know it was a boy it could just have easily been one of you stupid girls
yeah dumb girls
the case is closed whoever had the lice they're dead now we're moving on to civil war history  ulysses s grant
hope hope you're alive  my god  heh
help me help meeee
travis  over here travis if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees we'd all be dead
how many survivors
just the six of us and the vice president
you son of a bitch you had a chance to stop this so help me if we live through this i'm gonna see you rot in prison
what do we do now
we aren't out of this yet you two look for other survivors you get whatever food you can and bring it back here
who put you in charge
god did when he killed my wife
all right the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now so that we know to stay away from you
yeah come on we're gonna find out sooner or later
okay whoever you are you are now not only a licehead you're a liar you're only making this worse on yourself
you know what i'll bet it was you
me
this is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself
i don't think so kyle but you know what this is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice try to get everyone to blame me
you guys stop it this isn't getting us anywhere
that's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice stan
yeah try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal
and this is exactly what kenny would do stand here and say nothing
heh hey guys what would i do
let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads
it's too late the treatment would have killed it all
well i guess we're never gonna know there's no way to tell
there's a way there's a way to find out who had sickass head cooties and i'm gonna find it
it was him it had to have been him
yeah or you
mark mark you have to hang on
this isn't going to stop the world is rejecting us if we're gonna live we have to get off this planet
how
first we have to get out of the forest into the forbidden zone it's the only way we might even see another planet
the forbidden zone we'll be exposed we'll die out there
we'll die here look the world is getting rid of us don't you get it
getting rid of us youyou mean like it knows what it's doing
yes because maybe we rolled the dice too many times
i'm not leaving my husband
yeah huhi'll take my chances here
you can all stay here i'm gonna try to save my babih
i'll go with you there's nothing left for me here
i wanna go too
not a chance
look i know i messed up all right but i think you're right if we can get out of the forest we might find another place to live
if we find anything we'll try to send help for the rest of you  let's go  come on if you're comin' mister vice president
yeah right behind you
all right lock that door craig
what's this about cartman
i've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice  we're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties  lice feed on a person's blood and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream that saliva is monochromagnic so if an infected person's blood is touched by this hot metal coil say that person's blood will jump  meters into the air
ur ur re ur really
that's retarded you didn't come up with that experiment cartman you saw it in that movie the thing
this is a scientific test designed to
you saw it in the thing and you're wasting everyone's time
i thought you might say that kyle because you don't want to take the test do you
nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air
if it isn't going to work then what are you afraid of the only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice
yeah that's true
i have no problem taking the test i have nothing to hihuhiiihide
yeah me neither
all right fine i'll do the dumb test
everyone take a petri dish and a syringe we need at least  cc's of blood from each one of you
all right now everyone back over there  we'll start with what i already know
well guess that proves eric wasn't the one with head lice
it doesn't prove anything
yeah let's just see what your blood does kyle  huh i guess you're clean
yeyou guys we'd better go recess is almost over
it's all right it won't take much longer justahh ahhgh
what the hell
kenny
no way
you were right all along eric it was kenny
of course i was right i told you only poor people get lice
we've done it we've reached the forbidden zone  i've always heard stories about this place never thought it was real
it's real real as my love for my unborn babih
so what exactly is your plan travis
our ancestors came here from another world maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it
travis travis you're so wise so strong if we make it out of this i'd like to be with you
sorry babe but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  kelly

okay
their web site should have a calendar of events is there anything big going on in town today
yeah actually there is
what
there's a hillary clinton campaign rally  cartman cartman
sir there's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the hillary clinton rally today
what  this is cia head alan thompson
mr thompson you have to call off the clinton rally there's a terrorist in south park
what do you know
he just showed up out of the blue i need to speak with the president right away
i'm the head of the cia you can tell me
i said i will only talk to the president
look if you have information of a threat you could
lalalalalalalala
i will have you arrested for
lalalai can't hear you only the president lalalalalala
call is coming through now mr president
hello
president bush this is eric cartman are we on a secure line
huh who
look i know you're not the biggest hildog fan but she is in great danger right now
hildog
yes i understand i'll let ms clinton know
what is it brian
ms clinton we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today
is the thread credible
we aren't sure but perhaps it's best we call it off
no no i will not be bullied by terrorist threats your men do a good job brian i have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly
we've reached the rally site hildog
don't worry mrs clinton i'm sure everything will be fine
thank you chris
they know about the bomb
that is impossible we took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight
well somebody tipped off the cia i don't know how much they know but security has been heightened
that bomb must travel with the clinton rally to boston
the bomb won't make it to boston now with the heightened security it's only a matter of time before they find it
then we have no choice we have to move up the attack
i understand comrade
prepare yourself we detonate the bomb within the hour
kyle i'm at the clinton rally site but there's no sign of that kid
so then maybe you're wrong
nope i'm not wrong he must be somehow attacking remotely from his house did you find the address
yeah i crossreferenced his myspace page with realtorcom his parents moved into that green house on janice street
jesus that's on the other side of town all right kyle i'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you you ready
yeah  what is that
it's my balls
god damn it cartman
okay okay kyle let's stay focused here
people of south park it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect mrs hillary rodham clinton
it is so nice to be back in a small town like the one i came from
here we go
otis green anything on that bomb threat
we have the bombsniffing pig going through the crowd if there is a bomb the pig will find it
this is why i campaign in small towns like these because it is in towns like south park that you find the true america
oh my god she got a scent
what
the pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue terrorists have hidden a bomb
oh my god where where could they have stashed it
come on find it find
my god they hid it under the stage
no wait look
how much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on uh  on the education of all woo haha whoa there girl haha  uh uh on the education of all children  oh i declare
oh my god do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up mrs clinton's
mr thompson the kid who called in the warning was right we uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device and that they have most likely hidden it in mrs clinton's well in her
in her what
in her snatch sir
what
what is goin' on i wasn't finished
security measure mrs clinton probably nothing  yes
mr jeffries this is alan thompson with the cia we have reason to believe that mrs clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch
a what
a snatch it's the technical term for vagina
no i mean what kind of nuclear device
mr jeffries this is frank waters it's a suitcase nuke designed to fit in a woman's snizz it's called a snuke
what is goin' on brian
ms clinton it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz
oh my
what do we do can we disable the timer
it won't have a timer snukes are detonated remotely whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him
but then that means
yes if we don't find that detonator everyone in the town of south park is going to die forever
do we have that phone trace
the call is going through now sir
yeah
this is cia head alan thompson we spoke before about the
yes mr thompson
well we've just arrived in your town
why did you find something
yes there's a suitcase nuke in ms clinton's snizz
a snuke
that's right it's controlled by a remote detonator we have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off
i have the address of the house the terrorist moved into i'm almost there now where are you
we're on the town's main street right by an ice cream shop
oh dude i'm i'm right next to you
oh hey
dude we totally got let out of school
i know something big is going on take a look at this i did a google search for hillary clinton campaign rally right and one of the links was to youtube where this russian guy had a bunch of videos
russian
yeah this guy  vladimir stolfsky he had videos on youtube of every single rally
so he's a hillary clinton fan
no i crossreferenced his youtube profile with myspace and according to his blog he's an oldschool communist so what's he doing at every clinton rally
do a webcrawler search maybe he has podcasts up somewhere
oh that's a good idea
what is going on what have we done
they claim they don't know anything about an attack
big surprise
sir first pass of the house we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere
mr hakeem where is your son
we thought he was at school he's not at school
you're doing great ms clinton
do they know how long brian how long before the snuke in my snizz goes off
they'll find the detonator hildog
we can't wait for them to find the detonator if we can get to the bomb memaybe we can deactivate it can't somebody go and take a look inside mrs clinton's snizz
i'm not sending any of my men in there
are you almost ready to set off the bomb
everything is set we have the detonator up and running
mr hakeem we need to know where your son is
i tell you i do not know
this is getting us nowhere if he knows anything he's not saying
let me have time with him
what are you going to do

that's it we don't have a choice anymore somebody is going to have to go in and try to disarm the snuke manually
no it's too dangerous that snatch has not seen action in over  years it could be toxic
i'll do it i'll check out ms clinton's snizz
let me go please i am just a little boy
you called and warned the government of our plans what you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries we were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of america could attack
that's cool i'm fine with muslims invading
do you really think muslims are behind this terrorist threat
uhh yes of course
america had other enemies before the muslims you know who is america's oldest enemy
the russians
before that
the germans
before that
the germans again
before that i am talking about the oldest threat to america the greatest enemy america has ever known
you can't possible mean
two hundred years we've waited finally we will get those traitors to the crown  yes your majesty
the russians are ready to set off the diversion full sail
full sail your majesty
all right brian this is it get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in ms clinton's snatch
all right i'm nearing her snizz now
god help him
what do you see brian
it's dark cold
you're doing fine brian get as close as you can yyou have to look inside the snizz
uh uh all right i'm looking yes i see i see the device
you're doin' great brian hang in there
there's um metal housing some kind of threepronged triggering mechanism that wait there's there's something else here there's something
say again brian
there's something perched on the snuke's coil oh god it's looking at me
brian get out of there
wha what are you i have no qualm with you stay back stay back i agh aaagh
brian brian what's happening
it's eating my head it's eating my head
hoh my
i got it i got it according to paypal the russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on craig's list and got paid through ebay so that boston could be attacked by the british
the british
loyalist red coats
sir i found the russian's eharmony account it does list an address in south park
all right mapquest the address
i'll use google maps it has live traffic
good thinking
sir we have the terrorists' location im'ing you now
it was good knowing you comrade
please think about what you are doing the british are just using you you're going to die
yes but we will be rich
left flank prig prang and clear go go go
the game is over get down on the ground
how did they find us
we know about everything your diversion to help the red coats is over
it doesn't matter the detonator is on a timer you are too late in three minutes  what the hell
the power went out
well so then what time is it
oh crap
take 'em down
no i don't want to die without being paid
the detonator is secured general you are cleared to proceed
the rebel americans know of our attack
how
fire at will
yes
your majesty the attack has failed we were unable to end the american revolution
i see
well looks like we saved our country from british rule once again
yeah it just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people because actually most of the world hates us
well baahir i was thinking that maybe i owe you an apology
really
yes but then i realized that technically i don't because by being suspicious of you i saved your life and everyone else's so really you owe me an apology but that's cool
you didn't save everyone i did you were just out harassing muslims
but if i hadn't called you in the first place to check out the muslim you would have just stayed in bed sick all day right
maybe
maybe if i hadn't called you you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the clinton rally that means my intolerance of muslims saved america
that is so missing the point
me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off yes or no
thethat's not the right way to look at it i
yes or no kyle
no not not like you're saying
but that's all i'm saying today bigotry and racism saved the day baahir you get this right
baahir get away from that disgusting child get back home and start packing your things we are leaving this whole intolerant country
awwwww
okay who got rid of the muslims huh  that was all me simple thank you will suffice
in my easter bonnet with all the frills upon it i'll be the grandest lady in the easter parade
look at that one huh half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker i'm good
uh can i ask a question why do we do this
wha what do you mean why do we do this it's easter
right so why do we color eggs
wulll ssso that the easter bunny can hide them
yeah but why
stanley easter celebrates the day that jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins
so we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them
that's right
you don't see the missteps in logic with that  look i'm just saying that somewhere between jesus dying on the cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a a gap of information
stanley just dye your goddamned eggs
i don't feel like coloring eggs i don't get it
what is wrong with him
well he's just getting older randy maybe he's figured out the easter bunny isn't real
you know so little
and i want a baltor soldier doll for easter and five crash'n'go rc cars you got that do you have that
ahh don't you think that's
nono you don't ask me questions you are a rabbit i am a human so if you don't bring me what i want for easter i can fucking kill you
smile
bye easter bunny
oh my god
all right can you explain to me what's going on
huh
what is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that what does that have to do with jesus dying on the cross  it is symbolic are you trying to reference something that happened in biblical times  answer me
look kid ahh i'm j i'm just a guy in a costume
i know that but i figure you must have some knowledge of what easter's about if you're playing the easter bunny at the mall
huhuh easter's just easter just just go with it kid
no i'm not gonna just go with it i'm gonna find out what's behind all this
i need a break can i have a break  we have a problem somebody's onto us yeah he's askin' a lot of questions only a matter of time before he finds out what easter's really about yes i understand what must be done call the others
mom dad  anybody home
not now stanley i'm on the toilet
dad you've gotta help me
hang on i'm taking a crap
dad there's easter bunnies chasing me
what
they chased me from the mall i don't know what they want  they're coming in dad open the door  dad
we need to talk stan  ih it's okay guys
randy
yeah 'cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son
ohhh
tell the grand hare everything is okay i'll take it from here
i wanted to keep this from you stan i really wanted to wait until you were older but you just had to keep asking questions
why were those other rabbit guys chasing me
we have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us  we are all part of a secret society stan a very ancient very important society of men who follow the way of the rabbit and protect the secret of the easter bunny we are called the hare club for men
does mom know about this
duh it's the hare club for men chicks wouldn't understand
i don't understand
i belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years our identities have to be protected
could could you take off the ears please
stan you don't seem to understand how serious this is the secret of easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world
so what is the secret of easter
i can't tell you you have to be allowed into the society first but but perhaps it's time
i always knew this day would come when my son would be brought into the society reminds me of the day i was brought in by my father
grandpa's in it too
of course marshes have been in the hare club for men for generations all the way back to the beginning
dad do i have to wear this bag over my head the entire time
you aren't a member yet you can't know where our secret meetings take place we're going to a distant location an old building near a lake about  minutes away
you mean the old galveston lodge
dammit
hey bill
evenin' marcus
heh heh hey look at you
hey everybody
stan marsh welcome you must be very excited
must i
there he is there's my grandson
hi grandpa
i'm proud of ya billy
stan
tonight we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the secret bring out the rabbit
sanctum piter oteum deus ore uneumhippitus hoppitus reus hominein suspiratoreum lepus in re sanctumhippitus hoppitus deus domine
all hail the cute rabbit snowball
hail snowball
stan marsh are you ready to hear the secret of easter
yeah
are you sure son once you hear the secret you will be bound to the hare club for men forever
yeah i wanna know already
very well at the last supper jesus christ met with his  disciples it was there that
they found us
protect snowball
they're everywhere
come on we've gotta go  stan take snowball and get out of here
where am i supposed to go
just get out of here
where is the rabbit
where are you taking us
no i'm not goin' anywhere
jesus christ
who did you give the rabbit to  search the area the boy could not have gotten far
oh no
help
what happened
my dad's in a rabbitworshiping cult called the hare club for men they protect the secret of easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of snowball
i'm kind of finger painting right now
dude they took my dad away they even shot one of his fellow hares and now they're after me  do you know anything about easter what is the connection between jesus and rabbits and colored eggs
dude i'm jewish i have no idea
nelson  nelson nelson say something
my legs i i think they're broken
nelson do you know where we are where did they take us
don't know we traveled for hours kept blacking out
you
hi we'd like to speak to a  professor teabag
what is it in regard to
the history of easter
sorry boys it's a little late for me to be giving lectures
please do you know anything about the hare club for men
the keepers  the guardians of the secret
my dad is in it this rabbit is too somehow
come on in
the hare club for men has been around for centuries one of its most famous members was leonardo da vinci  behold the last supper the dinner christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified what food do you see on the table
just bread
really look to jesus's right  the food which is a little different color than the others
it kind of looks like an egg
yes the egg marks the secret it lies directly in front of  saint peter
who is saint peter
he was the disciple that jesus made into the first pope
eggsactly but there's something the church didn't tell you in actuality peter wasn't a man at all saint peter was a rabbit
peter rabbit
of course the church wouldn't allow da vinci to paint peter as a rabbit so he painted him as a man but left clues look closely
i don't see it
look closelier
he looks like a guy
look more closelier  with laser technology we can look beneath the paint the way da vinci originally painted it  that is saint peter  the original pope of christianity
i don't believe it
proof is everywhere look at the pope's hat  it makes no sense except that it was originally designed  for a rabbit
but why would jesus want a rabbit to run his church
because jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion men can be intolerant rabbits are pure but the catholic church buried the truth put a man in charge and the hare club for men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da vinci's painting alive
so the vatican took stan's dad
you dare to mock god by telling people st peter was a rabbit
you monster you have no right to wear that hat
trying to tell people that st peter was a rabbit is blasphemy you must admit you are wrong or burn in hell
it's saying stupid things like that that made jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge
i'm sorry i couldn't bring you the rabbit your holiness but they know where it is
the rabbit you call snowball is a threat to christ's church where is the rabbit
i don't know and even if i did know well i'd probably tell you because i don't wanna be here anymore
take him to be tortured
tortured huh but bill all this torturing and ninjas it just doesn't seem very christian
you asked for the help of the american catholic league let us do our job take him
no no you bunnyhating bastards don't do this
i don't get it why would the pope be holding my dad hostage for snowball
i believe snowball must be a direct descendant of st peter himself and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne
mr teabag get out
they found me
boys get out of here  head to the woods i'll try to buy you some time
check upstairs  upstairs clear try the office
in here
what's that
peeeeps
so what now
if the pope has my dad i have to give him what he wants
you aren't just gonna hand snowball over
what choice do i have there's nobody left who can help us  wait unless maybe there is  here hold this  jesus i know we haven't talked in a long time and i know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow but i don't know what to do and i could really use your help
i think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket
live from the vatican it's our easter vigil coverage
as holy saturday comes to an end the easter vigil at the vatican begins thousand have turned out to hear the pope and celebrate the resurrection  for this easter vigil the pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor with a massive rabbit stew
nooo noo no don't put m  aaaaaaaaaah
bill this seems extreme
the child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over
your holiness a child has arrived with a the rabbit
ya see
oh thank god hand it over stan they're gonna kill me give them the rabbit
yes hand it over
first you have to promise you won't hurt it and that you'll let everybody go
we promise
we swear it on the cross
just hand over the bunny stan
okay fine
stanley why did you do that i would have proudly died for that rabbit
you said hand over the bunny
no that is not the way we're remembering it
take them into custody
hey what the hell
bill we have zeh rabbit it's all we need
don't be soft your holiness these whores must be punished in front of everyone
you swore on the cross fatso
yeah too bad for you it was a double cross
oh we should've seen that coming
bill i'm not sure that doublecrossing people is very christian
it is what christ would've wanted
who are you to say that
it can't be
jesus
he is risen he is risen let the voices sing his praises on this holy day he is risen
jesus we thought you died in iraq
i have the power of resurrection or have you forgotten you all seem to have forgotten a lot of things
jesus you did answer my prayer
actually i was answering the prayer of nick donovan
ohh that's me neato
this is exactly why i put a rabbit in charge of the church benedictus because men are so easily led astray st peter was a rabbit and a rabbit should be pope
kill him
what
he goes against the church he must die
all right that does it bill i'm pretty sure that killing jesus is not very christian
you are soft weak you leave me no choice take them
what are you doing
i am the pope
you are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the lord  the easter vigil will go on as planned  every hare club member young and old will watch as their precious savior dies
what is your problem guy
lock up those two jews  we'll deal with them later
no no
a strange turn of events here at the vatican pope benedictus has stepped down ushering the new era of pope bill donohue
my people this easter i'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier
no listen we aren't rabbits  oof
forgive me jesus
we'll never get out in time to stop him
don't you have any superpowers
not as a mortal only in death wait that's it we have no choice kyle you're going to have to kill me
what
stab me with this  if i die i can resurrect outside the bars
nno way do it yourself
suicide is blasphemy there's no choice here kyle
dude you don't understand i'm a jew i have a few hang ups about killing jesus
just make it quick  through the neck i'll arise again immediately
don't make me do this
my son there is no time do it
eric cartman can never know about this
i understand and kyle happy easter
happy easter jesus
awgh
jesus
behold no longer will easter be about bunnies and colored eggs kill the rabbit
sorry little bunny
snowball
jesus
stop that rabbit is of holy descent
why won't you go away
one man cannot be the voice of the church
enough of this blasphemy i'm the pope now that means i am the voice of god
not anymore i'm removing you from your position
yaaay
all right jesus
sanctum piter oteum deus ore uneumhippitus hoppitus reus homine
your holiness what should we tell the world about how to run their lives  it isn't saying anything
yes just as ajesus intended it

you have to be careful with scissors

you guys you guys stop it listen to me everybody i got some bad news
what is it katie
they're closing down the bar for good
closing it down they can't do that
this is our home
yeah this is our home
well it's true i just talked to the owners they've sold the bar to persians
persians
so where are we supposed to go
we aren't going anywhere we have a history here persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body
mayor this is an outrage we are being discriminated against as lesbians
you're a lesbian now
that's right a proud lesbian and our home is being taken away
the bar has been sold to persian club owners i don't know what you want me to do about it
forbid the transaction this is happening all over the country mayor lesbian bars being bought out shut down it isn't right
yeah that's right
i'm sorry but my hands are tied the new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow you have to be out by then
have you seen how persians decorate they will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke
mrs garrison get out of here
well here's to some great times at this place
yeah guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out
now come on gals i can't believe what i'm hearing we can't just give up
well what are we supposed to do janet
we stand and fight when the persians come we tell them we aren't leaving les bos
actually it's lebow
no it's les bos  we are lesbos and as lesbos we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn
the persians have sent somebody to talk to us
hello my name is emir hadi my boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar
yes we are
well we want to assure you that when this place becomes another club persh you will all still be  welcome all they want is to make the place really nice we're going to put down some lovely blue carpet and gold curtain rods
i knew it i knew it
but you are still welcome to come my boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way
would you allow straight people in men
well we would allow whoev
choose your next words wisely persian
look uhh we don't have to offer you anything so i don't know why you're being so difficult this is crazy
no this isn't crazy this is les bos
ohhhhh
how dare you
and so it had begun by kicking the persian messenger in the balls the lesbos had sent a message  all over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff
as a group of lesbians in colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in
good for them
you go girls
the persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in
well fine if they're going to block the entrance we'll just bring like sixty of us i'll call more persians for help
the hours pass quickly and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the persians from entering
here they come
there's so many of them
lesbos positions
lesbians stand aside we're coming in to redecorate it
the hell you are you can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your persian buttholes
all right come on they can't stop all of us huuu
huuu
lesbos remember this day remember this fight  don't give them an inch  ow iranian faggot
come on seriously let us in
never
for hours the lesbos kept the persians back holding them off keeping them from decorating  finally the persians grew tired and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses they retreated  the lesbos had held
lesbohhhs
huok huok
the persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss
here he comes
rauf xerxes he sat atop a gold hummer with customized gucci accessories which only a persian would think was cool
mr xerxes the lesbos wouldn't move we could not get inside to redecorate
tumon how could you have failed me in this simple task i am so seriously pissed off right now i could bust a testicle
and with that the persian club owner came to a realization
i shall have to deal with these lesbos myself
girls i just want to say that i am very proud of you the way we kept those persians from takin' over our bar was lestastic
well that's great janet but what now we can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives
we can't i think it's pretty fun
we have to have a more solid plan something we can use against them permanently
maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner
hey that's a great idea betsy we need somebody working on the inside
whattaya mean
if we could get some persians on our side we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner
but who's gonna spy on them for us we don't know any persians
it's okay there's people you can hire for this kind of thing
que paso que paso looking for work s trabajo
yeis
we looking work s
all right we need you to infiltrate some persians who run club persh and dig up some dirt on the owner
okay
sure
okay
yeah
janet how is this gonna work they don't look persian
sure they do  just have to gel the hair put on a silk shirt some gold chains and tons of cologne  persian
s
wow
all right mexicans take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out the address is in there too
okay
no problem
yes
s
and mexicans please hurry our girl bar has very little time
a full day passed and the lesbos knew a second persian attack was imminent outside lesbo lookouts kept watch ready to alert the others the lesbo leader sat nervously inside her plan to dress mexicans as persians to act as spies  perhaps it had failed she looked around at her fellow lesbos they were tired in order to keep her lesbos awake she had no choice she would have to make coffee  with fresh coffee brewed the lesbos found new life but would it be enough
the persians are attacking again
take positions lesbos
get outside
no wait wait that's not the persians it's the mexicans
really
how can you tell
let them through it's okay
hola como estas
hola
did you uncover anything are the persians doing anything illegal
ahh no they're not doing anything illegal
aare you sure
no but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge
what secret  oh my god are are you sure about this
s
janet janet the persian boss is here he wants to talk to you and you alone
it's okay it's time i met this rich persian asshole face to face
why are you lesbians being so difficult
because we're protecting the only home we have
i don't know why you have to be all superlame about this
you know a long time ago when i first realized i was a lesbian i felt isolated confused and finally i found a place that accepts me for who i am
okay how about this  i will make you the manager of club persh you'll make good money
that's a generous offer xerxes but you see there's something i know about you  i know you're actually a woman
how how did you find that out
i hired mexicans to spy on you they saw you working out at curves
you don't understand women can't be the boss in persian culture nobody can know about this
yeah and you know why because men are all assholes they make you feel ashamed for being a little big or manly looking  but not lesbos we accept other women for who they are inside
you do seriously
have you never even thought of being with another woman before
no i don't even know how two women can make love unless they just kind of  scissor or something
ohh yeah scissor me xerxes
ohh that feels so supercool
yeah scissor
ohh i'm a new woman
and so it was that les bos was saved the persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar for no dyke should be without cocktails
thanks for everything xerxes
no thank you friend
hey aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now
the school hired a substitute to cover for me
hand so to find the sum of the two fractions zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator
s
s s yes yes that's right
s
these guys are pretty good
yeah i think i'm actually learning something
all right this time it's me and kenny versus you two assholes
fine
oh dude what's with all the homeless people  sir could you move a little please
spare some change
aw dude he smells like kenny's house  get out of here
you guys that's not cool these people have nowhere to go  they don't have food or shelter we have to do something
well dude what are we supposed to do
yeah what are we supposed to do
no kyle's right you guys we should do something
really
yeah i know what you're thinking kyle and i'm with you i know exactly what we should do
gather 'round and witness the glory as eric cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless
thank you thank you  the ramp ready
yeah it's all set
he won't make it
excuse me this isn't exactly what i had in mind
all right here we go jimmy
oh aww
yes i did it  i jumped over the homeless  yes
yehes
that was a sweet idea kyle
god damn it that wasn't my idea
all right people we need to come up with answers there are homeless sprouting up all over town what are we supposed to do
well i i short of had an idea
please mr valmer
we could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers at least that way they'd be pleasant to look at
oh that's a good one good idea i like it
well i was thinking we could turn the homeless into tires so that we'd still have homeless but we could use them on our cars
ohh that's a good one
nice one randy
like it
that's like recycling
all right enough i find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive the homeless aren't monsters they are people like you and me
you mean they've adapted copied our dna
excuse me i am the top researcher of homeless studies for park county i don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town but i do know that we must be extremely careful if we give them anything there could be more

kyle what were you thinking

i've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours see everything is there heart lungs kidneys they're almost identical to us in every way except for one  the homeless can survive solely on change

we just came to ask a question
you homeless or homeowners
we're nine
yeah well that makes you homeless so get out of here before you die
look we just need help with our own homeless problem
yeah this jew here made them take over our town
shut up cartman
cartman eric cartman the kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard
youu heard about that
heard about it they said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump
thirty was hard enough
oh god it wasn't thirty it was one he jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard and he barely made it over that guy
kyle knock it off we're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless not how many homeless cartman can jump
please we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town
well that was easy
the homeless first started arriving in evergreen about three months ago at first there were only a few of them askin' for change sleeping in the parks but then more showed up and we realized there was somethin' different about them they fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments we knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes and then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't the people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know  nobody could trust anybody fights broke out war  that's when i started suspecting that  my own wife who i'd been living with for twenty years was actually homeless so i had to burn her in her bed while she slept  after she died i vowed i wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town so we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all
you son of a bitch  you didn't solve your homeless problem you just sent all your homeless to south park
that's right yes
what
i knew it it wasn't because i gave that guy twenty dollars the homeless all came from here
and it was texas who sent them to us people in san antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place evergreen was
but then you didn't solve the problem you just moved it
right but we survived
dehhhnyihhhs
christine
you sonothatitch you tried to kinn me

oh doctor can you help him
we don't know very much about tourette's i'm afraid but we will give your son all the help we can

randy have you called the people from the guinness book of world records i mean this might seriously be the biggest crap in history
that's why i gotta make sure to keep it safe
randy marsh
aw crap
what the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house
the guys agree sharon it could be a record holder
why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is
guinness world records america how can i help you  the biggest crap we actually don't keep track of that record sir  because we don't want to  look we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification  you need to call the european fecal standards and measurements office in zurich  you're welcome  jeez another one  guinness world records america
uhh yes hello my name is randy marsh and i believe i took the world's biggest crap
you need to call the european fecal standards and measurements office in zurich their number is listed on their web site
herr president take a look at this  it is a crap sent to us from the united states
very niiice  has it been checked for accuracy
it appears to be legitimate based on the photo we estimate that the crap is over eight and a half courics
we'd better get on a plane right away
hm enshnusen
verron snusunarich
what was your primary diet for this poo mr marsh
uhh mostly pf chang's general tso's chicken oh and uh and a lot of uh aunt jemima's frozen sausage biscuits in the morning
i believe i detect some cabbage as well
ohh yes i had a lot of kim chee
you have got to be kidding me
these guys are from zurich sharon they're europeans
it is a tremendous crap mr marsh
for the love of god
your crap officially weighs  courics
courics
the standard measuring unit for human feces one katie couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement
the current record is a crap weighing  courics
but that means
that's right you are the new world's champion
really yuh you mean really  hey stan i uh hey sharon hey everybody
well i guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken
he has won twentytwo grammy's countless humanitarian awards and is the only person ever to be nominated for an academy award a golden globe and the nobel peace prize ladies and gentlemen bono
thank you thank you so much for this newest award it means so much  oh excuse me i must be getting another award  yes
yes bono sir we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken
what that's impossible how big was it
we are here to honor the first american to bring home the distinguished efsm medal for biggest crap ever taken
hey look sharon it's the president hehey sharon
to present the award i give you the dean of the efsm sir orloff broloff
thank you senator for over a hundred years the european fecal standards and meas
herr broloff herr broloff
das shpoitenhoff  ahhh ladies and gentlemen i understand we have just received a special videotaped announcement from bono
oh bono cool
could we play the tape on the big screen please
hello everyone i am bono  for years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in africa and today i have very exciting news last night at twenty past eight i took a crap weighing nine and a half courics
whoa
bono
as you can see it is one solid piece  it is my biggest crap to date and i swear to its authenticity thank you and god bless
you heard it ladies and gentlemen the official biggest crap is  courics congratulations to bono
bono wooooo
dad um i think dinner's almost ready
i almost did it i almost made something of myself you know when you get real close you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter  i mean this was something i made something that came from me that was a part of me the only thing i ever made that was any good
gee thanks a lot dad
you're welcome  and i just i know that this late in my life i'll never come so close to finally having meaning
come on guys lasagna's ready
oh lasagna's ready  you hear that stan mom says lasagna is ready i can see through your sarcasm sharon
what are you talking about
you can say it sharon i know bono's better than me i'm sorry i'm not bono all right sorry that i don't have billions of dollars and a nobel prize nomination
randy this is ridiculous
oh that's real mature sharon just act like everything's funny it's a big joke to you isn't it just a big joke  don't touch me
can you believe him all this over what guy took the biggest crap
you don't understand mom you just don't understand
wha wha
how come they just let that bono guy send a picture of his crap
'cause he's bono that's why
but he could have faked it it isn't fair
doesn't matter he's got the record now there's nothing i can do
oh yes there is you could do it again
what
think about it you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time imagine if you actually worked at it
hey hey that's right
nooo i can't go through all that again it's too much
come on randy i'll bet you can crap that big again easy
with the right diet and training who knows what you're capable of
guys forget it it's over it was a fluke crap i'll never take one that big again
is it over randy we all saw that crap you took that was no fluke there's something inside you that made you able to do it randy you have a gift now who knows why god chose you but he did and if you walk away now you'll always wonder how big a crap you could have taken
i would need a lot of help
that's what we're here for
come on randy what do you say
i say  let's give bono a run for his money  yeah  yyeeaahhhh
tonight a possible attack on iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the middle east
oh no
but first the record for the world's biggest crap will it again be broken
agh
randy marsh of colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap spending nearly every waking hour at pf chang's
is this really newsworthy
you just don't understand
you're right i don't
at the same time some people are questioning bono's current record entry saying nobody has ever seen it in person bono could not be reached for comment as he is currently in africa helping the needy
hello hello
marsh is attempting to break the record again we thought you should know
he can't beat my nine and a half courics
well he's going to try
fine but he has to take the crap in front of you in zurich
bono we've never had that rule before
i's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating if he doesn't crap in zurich it shouldn't count
ultrasound is very simple mr marsh we're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first
oooooo
okay take a deep breath  i see the crap now i can't say for sure but i i'd say is about  courics
fourteen
that's great randy
can i can i see it
sure this is your colon aand here  is the feces growing inside your belly
ahhh
guys we have a problem  i talked to the efsm and they say randy has to take the crap in zurich
in zurich
they say that bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied
i'm sorry mr marsh i i cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition it is never safe to fly during your turd trimester
hi could i speak with mr bono please
mr bono you have a young gentleman caller
get the jet ready bovis i've got to be going
hi my name is stan marsh my dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap
oh right he can't make it to zurich right
that's kind of what i'm here for do you really need the biggest crap record could you maybe see your way to just letting my dad have this one
let him have it why would i do that
look you you gotta understand sir my dad's never won an award for anything ever he doesn't have one single trophy i mean even i have a secondplace trophy for most sports illustrated subscriptions sold
i have the firstplace trophy for that
dude don't you have enough i mean you got tons of money a jet and the biggest rock band in the world a hot wife and you've been knighted i mean at some point can't you just kind of fuck off
i want people to know that i'm worth something that i matter
all i'm asking is that maybe with this one thing let my dad be number  aand you can still be number
number two number two
agh
nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it take it back take it back
i take it back
say i'm not number two
you're not number two
that's right i'm not
what is wrong with that guy
your father is in grave danger come with me
it must be quite a crap
come on randy you have to push
what are you saying how do you know my dad is gonna die
because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before
so bono's newest record is a lie
look i first knew something was wrong when i looked at bono's first award for biggest crap it said he took it in
so
so that's the year bono was born then it all made sense to me how could bono be so talented so caring and yet seem like such a piece of crap because he is crap don't you get it bono is not the record holder
he's the record
yes
i can't do it i can't do it
the crap is simply too big mr marsh we must perform a caesarean
but then does it still count
oh no the biggest crap means you crapped it out
i believe that's true we are sorry mr marsh but if you cannot crap out the crap it's not really a crap
no nooo
there there randy you you gave it your best shot
i want my wife sharon sharon
what
i'm sorry sharon sorry that i let you down sorry i can't crap like bono
well congratulations bono it appears your record is intact
i had a feeling it would be
wait stop dad your old crap counts bono never took a second crap to beat yours
get him out of here
what are you talking about young man
somebody's been keeping it a secret bono was never the record holder he's the record
it's not true kill the kid i want him dead
it's too late bono the boy has learned the truth
herr broloff what do you know of this
it's true i'm afraid you see until mr marsh came along i was the record holder for the biggest crap i took it back in  it was the most amazing crap i'd ever taken
poppa no say nothing more

i kept the crap in my office nursed it fed it biddy and soon biddy made him strong biddy made him grow up into one of the most influential figures of our time  easy bono that hurts the biddy
biddy
my little crap has accomplished many things but he could never shed the fact that he was really a number two so he spent his life trying to be number one in everything
that's why he's able to do so much try to help so many people but still seem like such a piece of shit

dude
kyle suck my balls
dad where do leprechauns come from
from ireland
so why would one come to america to warn us about a terrorist attack
kyle leprechauns aren't real you're almost nine now you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary
i thought i did
ohhh ms broflovski how are you this fine evening
ohhello eric  kyle your friend is here
hello mr broflovski ike nice evening isn't it well kyle shall we go up to your room for a few minutes
get out of here cartman we're eating dinner
uhh kyle i believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth
i'm not doing it fatass
doing what
we had a deal kyle
just get out of here
you signed an agreement kyle
i don't care if i signed an agreement
ah hey now kyle if you made a deal with somebody you have to stick by it
thank you mr broflovski
what was the agreement
that if he could prove leprechauns exist i would suck his balls
whatwhatwhat
and there was a leprechaun you saw it kyle
hey dudes
hey kyle so how was it
how was what
sucking cartman's bballs
i didn't suck his balls all right and i'm not going to
dude why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place
uch i didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun and i still don't why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack there's another explanation for all this
excuse me have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately
what do you know about the leprechaun
ooooo then you did see him  that's splendiferous i want you to tell me everything he said where was he what was he doing
all right i've had enough leprechauns are imaginary
well of course they are but just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real haven't you boys ever used your imagination  you young man how would you like to be a cowboy or a swashbuckling pirate  and you how would you like to be an astronaut faaar out in space all it takes is a little  imagination
who the hell are you
still not convinced eh i tell you what boys what say we all take a ride on my imagination flying machine
dude
hop aboard kids i have something to show you
uhhh are you gonna rape us
ubeuh uh n no
ah all right then
come on guys
watch it fellas i'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us
all aboard the imagination balloon some people feel imagination isn't real but i tell them that they're wrong'cause whenever i want to play and pretend i just sing the imagination sooong
are you gonna take us somewhere or not
oh ohhh but my boy we're already here
whoa
what is this place
this is imaginationland  it's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together  citizens of imaginationland we have distinguished guests from the world beyond
hello
welcome to imaginationland i am the lollipop king
we are honored to have creators in our kingdom
now good news everyone these boys did see the leprechaun
what did he tell you did he have any news
well he said there was gonna be a that there was gonna be a
allah
oh fuck no
awwwgh
aaaaah
stan we have to get out of here
quickly boys get on my back
fellas fellas wait  hold on fellas
butters
don't leave me fellas come back
dude
hey guys
goodbye butters
aah aaah wha where oh oh dude oh it was just a dream it was all just a crazy dream huh oh my god
hello
dude did you finish your math homework i kind of lost track of time last night
no no i i hardly got any sleep i had this whole messed up dream about some gay mayor guy taking us to imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live
and then it got attacked by terrorists
yeah how'd you know
dude i had the same dream we jumped on a dragon's back and and butters got left behind
stan stanley you haven't seen your little friend butters have you
why
our darling butters never came home last night
what did they say
we don't wanna jump to conclusions but we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped butters sodomized him over and over again and then fed his genitals to wild animals  there there darling
dude
ladies and gentlemen i have dire news yesterday at approximately  hours terrorists successfully attacked our imagination
our imagination
how
the imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years the effects of the attack are so far unimaginable
we've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public
no it's just a care bear
oh my god
later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage this one reading a forced statement
praise to the mighty allah his divine grace aand will have brought forth this day  oh jeez  uhhh nnow see your safety is at our whim this is the price you pay america you have defiled allah and now we will turn your imagination against you death to the infidels  can i go now  stan kyle could you could you get me out of here
gentlemen the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination it's only a matter of time before our imaginations start running wild
i believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt  a travesty has occurred and i want justice kyle broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract and yet to date he has made no effort nor does he show any intention of ever sucking my balls  i've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation and he has thus refused i stand before you with dry balls your honor i've provided witnesses collected testimonials and still my balls remain dry i want what i'm entitled to
mr broflovski did you agree to orally imbibe mr cartman's scrotum and testicles
i
is this not your signature on the contract
uh wuh but come o come on really i mean aren't there more important things going on right now
from what i've been presented and the evidence put forth the court has no choice but to order you to place mr cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth and draw upon it succulently for no less than  seconds
yesss
you have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls if after that time you still refuse the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt next case
thank you your honor this isn't a victory for me this is a victory for the justice system and my balls
what i am about to tell you is highly classified two days ago muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination  frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them
in times like these the government often turns to hollywood for help you creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't
that's why we've asked you here m night shyalamalam  the sixth sense signs the village all very clever films but can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists
what if  what if it turns out they aren't terrorists but they're actually werewolves from the future
n no no they're terrorists they've been linked to al qaeda
but what if al qaeda it turns out is the group being terrorized by aliens
no no that's not an idea that's a twist we need ideas
how about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us but really we were all already dead
get him out of here  mr bay can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists
i believe i can  we start by making a big cg building and then we have a meteor go crosshh  and it and it's all like craawwwll  aand motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters right
no no we need ideas how to stop the terrorists
an eighteenwheeler spins out of control and it's all like brosshh  and then this huuuge tanker full of dyna
those aren't ideas those are special effects
i don't understand the difference
i know you don't get him out of here  aaand being that we are all big mel gibson film fans we thought maybe you could help us
ah my nipples they hurt they hurt when i twist them
yes uh i don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists
how about this you have that tape that the terrorists made right well maybe if you did a background check on that videotape you might find somebody who doesn't belong somebody who doesn't fit in imaginationland ohhh
heyy that's not a bad idea
yeah say what you will about mel gibson but the son of a bitch knows story structure get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it
oogh yess
all the imaginary characters in the tape were identified sir count chocula cinderella snarf from thundercats but here  nothing in american folklore or storytelling match this kid he appears to be just some kid
i want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat  if that kid isn't imaginary i want to know who he is where he's from and who his friends are
yes sir
who are you
uh excuse me uh mr terrorist sir  uh i'm actually not imaginary aand um my pmy parents are gonna ground me if i don't get back  aaah  okay sorry uh sorry
can you tell what the terrorists are doing
they're going something to rockety rocket
no leave me alone haaa
it doesn't make sense what do they want with rockety
the only reason they would  oh my god they're gonna blow up the barrier
uh what's the barrier
the wall the wall which separates the evil side of imaginationland from the good side
no no you can't blow up the barrier are you insane
we can't let this happen
it will be the end of imaginationland
yeah you have to stop them kid
me woo what am i supposed to do
don't you get it if the terrorists blow that barrier all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over imaginationland for good you have to do something
waaahaa
thanks for coming everyone the big moment is almost here as soon as kyle arrives
he's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude
he has to he's been ordered by the court
hey he's here

we aren't going to hurt your little friends we just need information
no no he has to suck my balls  no kyyyyle
no noooo
hold on hold on a second  now you really should think about this i mean uh i i know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere but will it really if you destroy that wall all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose but will it really make you terrorists feel better maybe it's time for us all to just get along
allah
aaaaaaah jesus christ no
that was your plan to stop them
yyeah and that's not a heartfelt speech
that's fucking stupid  they are coming
glad i picked you up kid it's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
yeah well when a man has been wronged he no longer cares about danger
you goin' to washington to visit family
i've got unfinished business you go through life being told there's justice then you learn that the only real justice  is the justice you take  make no mistake kyle before this is over you will suck my balls

waaaa it's alien  predator wha  huh  waaaaah haaaaaaaa
look we already told you everything we know some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into imaginationland
what we want to know is how we need to find a way into imaginationland you've been there how did you do it
we just went on a balloon ride
there must have been some kind of portal or doorway
dude we don't remember
do you realize what's goin' on here terrorists have attacked our imagination and now our imaginations are running wild  you'd better start remembering
it was the chinese wasn't it
what
we've suspected that the chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination  is that where you were
no
that's it isn't it where do the chinese keep this portal how does it work
it is better than ours
your what
our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in  to fight the soviets
shhh tom that's supersecret
ohh i'm sorry sir
wait the us government has a portal to the imagination
aw see good job tom why don't you just tell them everything about project x
yes sir  we built a portal to the imagination to use against the russians during the cold war but we never got a
that was sarcasm i was being sarcastic you fucking idiot
aw jeez i'm really sorry sir
if you already built a doorway to the imagination then why do you need us
all right we might as well show it to them  goddammit tom
every night the dream is the same  i'm on my way to visit my friend kyle because we had a bet that if i could prove leprechauns were real he would suck my balls  and it turns out i was right time to pay up kyle  but then  no nooo  it's been taken from me i have dry balls balls so dry they explode like dust
you okay kid
no i've got dry balls and i'm running out of time
ever since the cold war the us government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination it is called project imagination doorway
that's not very imaginative
according to all the tests and the data the doorway should work but it never has
but we're close sir we're real close
they've been saying that for over forty years
you're the ones right the kids who have been in the imagination
ah i guess
what was the sequence that got you inside we know there's some kind of resonance code but we can't figure it out
look we're sorry you guys but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there
song you didn't say anything about a song before
what song
the imagination song
that could be it the fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code
quick boys how does the imagination song go
imaginaaaation imaginaaaation
sir uh i'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate ih it's weak but it's nanoresponding to something
was there more to the imagination song ha how does the rest of it go
imaginaaaation imaginaaaa
no no dude it went up there
imaginahehey
imaginaeh
dude we don't remember it was really long and stupid
i'm just about through playing with you boys we're running out of time you have to remember that song in its entirety
mayor mayor what are we supposed to do
please sir i have to get home to my world
oh well all you have to do is tap your heels together three times
really
no you fucking dipshit that was a joke
mayor what are we supposed to do shnarf shnarf
get to castle sunshine it's your only hope
castle sunshine
through the gumdrop forest others will be hiding there go run look out for the evil characters they're assembling on the yum yum mountain
we are free now all of imaginationland is ours
not all foolish orc there are still parts of imaginationland we don't control
tomorrow we shall build our own castle right on this spot
who put you in charge krueger i am the most evil character here
nonsense  your evil is stale
i am the most evil imaginary character
now come on y'all we shouldn't be fightin' we're supposed to all be on the same side
yeah you're all right squirrelly squirrel
yaaaay
what evil imaginary characters are they
they were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his christmas story
now come on y'all we can't waste time arguing there could still be survivors out there we need to hunt them down and kill them
and eat their flesh
b'hut first we should rape them
how about we kill them and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant
say that's a great idea beary bear
man i do not want to meet the kid that dreamt those things up
look i want some goddamn answers you brought my friend here to washington where is he what is going on
i'm sorry sir that information is classified
something is going on and i have a right to know where my friend is
there's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on
let me handle this  i'm sorry but there is no such thing as project imagination doorway  imagination doorway it was started in the sixties as a secret government project right
imaginaaation imagina
waitwaitwait maybe that's where he went really flat like that halfstep key change imaginaation
right then it was imaginaation imaginaation imaginaatioon
it's open it's open
getting readings from the other side the that's it we've made an opening to our imagination sir
all right that's enough we've still got a lot of work to do people its time to go in and get our imaginations under control
how much further to castle sunshine
snarf i'm not sure snarf snarf i've never been

now come on y'all we can do better than that
hey i know let's all pee in her empty eye socket
let's make her eat her own eyeball and then pee in her empty eyesocket
how about we get someone with aids to pee in her eyesocket so she dies all slowlike
nobody here has aids

now don't be down y'all i bet we can find some aids out in the forest
dude run run ruuun

i was thinking of using a highspeed shutter with a low depth of field what do you think
goddammit cartman will you stop wasting time i wanna get this over with
no you're right kyle a higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus  there we go  now kyle when you're sucking my balls are you gonna think about how right i was about the leprechaun or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth
let's just do it
in time kyle you certainly are eager for balls aren't you are you ballfamished ballsstarving you see kyle i wonder if at this moment you are actually

and i'm snarf snarf snarf snarf snarf
and what imaginary character are you
oh uhh uh i'm not imaginary ah i'm butters
what's a butters
the mayor brought him and some other kids into imaginationland just before the terrorist attack
so you came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists that seems like quite a coincidence
i well i was just playin' with my friends and then wuwe caught a leprechaun and then this guy
you caught the leprechaun take him
perseus he's not against us snarf snarf
talk to me what's going on
something is coming through the gate from the other side
what is it
its like a half man half bear
and half pig
oh no no wait it's like a half bear half manpig
look out
no i think it's more like a half man and half pigbear
reverse the doorway send it back through
aaahhh
kyle
aaaaaaaaaaaa
please i didn't help the terrorists get into imaginationland honest
that is for the council of nine to decide
don't worry kid the council of nine consists of some of the most highlyregarded imaginary characters in all imaginationland
fellow council these are indeed dark times the evil forces amass at our gates as we speak zeus believes we should evacuate
yes their power outmatches ours if they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it
and what say you morpheus
how our we to know that they will let us go their offer could be a trap
perhaps we must flee to the temple of alderon surely they wouldn't chase us there
no we can't come on you guys this is our home we have to fight to keep it the way it was meant to be
i'm with jesus the evil characters aren't going to just us go  that may be popeye but we don't have a choice
forgive my intrusion council of nine but this boy has infiltrated from the real world
bring him here
clear  i'm sorry he's gone
no kyle can't die
i'm sorry young man
kyle
well at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls
nnnooo  no he has a strong heart he wants to live come on kyle come on buddy
he's gone little boy
zap him again  do it
charging
do it  come on buddy
clear
come on buddy  get out of here  godammit kyle you never walked away from anything in your life now fight  fight fight right now  fuhight fuhuhight  fight  give him some air  there easy breathe easy
i believe this child was brought into imaginationland for a reason perhaps the mayor knew something we don't
what are you saying aslan that if we are to take back control we might
yes if we are to take back control from the evil forces this little boy might be the key
awww i'm the key could i not be the key morpheus i don't wanna be the key
if you ever wanna see your home again little boy you'll have to rise to this challenge
but i but i'm supposed to be at school right now uh and instead i got i got snarf and popeye and luke skywalker all pissed off
it is a dark time for all of us young boy but know that if you believe in yourself everything will turn out all right
sir are you sure about this
we have no choice terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable there's no other option  we have to nuke our imagination
wake up kyle
imaginationland used to be a happy place but then the terrorists attacked  and so many of us were killed  the barrier came down and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed  now our final battle will take place the evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out
this is gonna be fun huh
we prepare for a battle we cannot win  sweet and cuddly imaginary characters many who have never held a weapon  must now fight for their very lives we are too few in number  but we have one hope that is where you come in young boy  only you can help us win this battle
wuh what can i do
you have a power here that you have yet to understand
back it up  look  right there  see that  what does that look like to you it's manbearpig  i told you it was real  look again  there half man half bear and half pig do you see it
yes we see it mr gore
something big is going on and the american people need to know what i'm off

don't try to change the subject kyle  you've done a really good job of getting out of this bet but it's finally time to settle get ready for your sundae kyle with extra nuts
aslan the evil characters are almost here
get everyone to the battlefield defend the castle walls quickly young boy we need your powers now
what powers ah i don't understand
you are real you are a creator that means you can imagine things into existence here
i ci can
santa claus was killed in the terrorist attack the first thing we need is for you to bring him back
how
you just have to focus your mind imagine santa and nothing else
how am i supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on
think only of one thing imagine it believe in it
whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be
butters  you are grounded mister you hear me  grounded
aaaaaaaaa no nonono no no no
what are you doing we need santa
i'm trying
come on kid imagine santa believe in santa
you must believe in santa
believe in santa right now
gaa haa
kevin can i get some more bounce off that too 'kay let's just go with a    split
carman will you shut up i'm trying to find out what's going on
a new terrorist attack seems to have taken place this time in our imagination  al gore brought this video to the public's attention sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on
we were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over but two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination and now our imaginations are running wild
our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told
by attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot and we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination
is nuking our imagination really prudent
aren't there other more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control
couldn't we trying sending kurt russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the
we tried that and kurt russell was raped by christmas critters
aooch
the pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real the military doesn't need senate approval to nuke them
that's bullcrap man you can't nuke our imagination
don't nuke our imagination bro wooo
mike does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination
uh clearly they don't steven and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real i cite a famous case of cartman v broflovski in which a us court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun
yes i believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case
that's right steven yeah
oh for the love of god
hello can anybody hear me
stan dude is that you
kyle where are you i i don't see you
no i'm not there i'm at a hospital i i'm hearing you in my imagination
oh that makes sense
dude what's happening
i'm in like a gumdrop forest i just saw strawberry shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye  hahang on i think something really big is about to go down
the evil characters are here
there are so many of them haaaaa
there's no time left you have to get control of your imagination and bring santa back now
santa saaanta
think jolly old santa red suit white beard
red suit white beard ssssanta
how does that look can you see my balls and the sundae in frame
a shocking new development in the nuking of imagination
the supreme court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them
thank you
oh no
this of course overturns any imaginationbased verdicts in the past including the famous cartman v broflovski ballsucking case
what
so it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation one they are calling operation nuke the imagination through the imagination doorway
kyle what's happening
the government is gonna nuke imaginationland
what you can't let them do that
what am i supposed to do
dude you have to stall them  uh uh oh what is that hey gget out of here leave me alone
stan stan
where are you going
i'm going to try to save stan and butters from getting nuked
okay okay but you you have to suck my balls first real quick
no i don't the decision was overturned
we had a deal kyle
yeah that leprechauns were real and the government just declared they aren't technically real so i was right it's over i don't have to suck your balls
it isn't over  it isn't over kyle i have not waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet go ahead and go but i swear on my life before this day is over you will suck my balls i swear it
i need more spinach for popeye
iee got one i got him
hey there
we're losing the battle there are simply too many of them
then the day is lost
wait aslan look
what what happened
you did it kid
quickly santa they need you on the battlefield
huh  oh all right  make way for santa
now you see your potential young creator but there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day
this area is restricted little boy
please i need to talk to the people inside they can't set off that nuke
get behind the line with the other protesters
no nukes in our imagination bro wooo
uhn you don't understand my friend is in imaginationland i can hear him in my head
you potsmokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here so back off
stop that nuke
stop that nuke
stop that nuke
what's going on here  the military has to do this it's their only way to kill manbearpig
good butters now imagine some more archers on the castle walls
huwhoa
aslan we're losing the battle
we managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves but now our troops are being shot down by the cavity creeps
cavity creeps
we make holes in teeth we make holes in teeth
what can destroy the cavity creeps
only crest gel with tartar control
quickly you must imagine a giant crest gel
yes
his powers are getting stronger we might just have a chance here
aslan we've captured a spy he was sneaking around the gumdrop forest
stan  hey look i imagined stan here
no no i got sucked through operation imagination doorway at the pentagon
project imagination doorway
never mind the battle is almost won we can deal with him later
no no you don't understand there's a nuke the government is about to level this entire place
what
wull why would they nuke imaginationland
so the terrorists can't ever use it against us again
we can get imaginationland under control the chosen one just needs more time
the chosen one
yeah it turns out i'm the key
missile launch sequence initiated
all right people i want this nuking done by the books
sir we have a security breach
what
there's an unauthorized entry alert sirit's coming from sector two
sector
what the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real
what
you just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real who are you to say what's real think about it is blue real is love really real
imaginary things are things made up by people like santa and rudolph
yeah and they detract from real things like jesus
maybe jesus is imaginary too
ooooh you'd better not say that you'll go to hell
it's possible that hell is also imaginary
uh so then we're about to nuke hell that's a good thing right
hell yeah that's a good thing yeah
what if heaven is imaginary we'd be nuking heaven
yeah but it wouldn't be real
so it'd be all right
look maybe they're all part of the same thing santa and jesus and hell and leprechauns maybe they're all real in the same wway right
santa claus and leprechauns are imaginary but jesus and hell are real
well then what about buddha
well of course he's imaginary
awww see now you're being intolerant tom
am i real
all right enough keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand
no leprechauns are real goddammit
kyle kyle what happened
nothing
what
nothing happened there's nothing i can do
dude you can't let the government fire off that nuke
they say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real
well you have to convince them they are real
no way dude then i'd have to suck cartman's balls
whatever it takes you have to do it all right  hang hang on kyle jesus wants to talk to you
huh
hello kyle this is jesus
oh boy
what seems to be the problem my child
jesus i can't do anything  i'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government  uh hello jesus
no eh hey kyle this is luke skywalker
aah
look i know this seems like an impossible task but do you remember when i brought down the death star i m i mean that seemed impossible too right
yeah i guess
uh okay now now hold on because superman is here and he wants to say something
kyle this is superman
hi superman
i know that saving people can be a big responsibility but no matter what it takes it's worth it
i know
you can do this kyle how hang on because hercules wants to talk to you
oh god
yes god is here too he's gonna talk to you right after captain crunch
popeye i need some help here
popeye is being killed by christmas critters
gaw guguh getskug off of me
hey what is that
more spinach for popeye  imagine an m for jesus
all right
the boy is doing it everything is going to be okay
missile launch in one minute
goddamnit you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything
prepare for launch
sir we have a security breach
what
there's an unauthorized entry alert sirit's coming from sector two
sector
kyle
the hell are you doing back here
listen you don't have to do this our imaginations aren't running wild anymore
why is it so easy for children to break into the pentagon
you have to stop
if i'm not mistaken you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real so why do you care what happens
because i  i um because i think they are real it's all real think about it haven't luke skywalker and santa claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room i mean whether jesus is real or not he he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have and the same could be said of bugs bunny and aand superman and harry potter they've changed my life changed the way i act on the earth doesn't that make them kind of real they might be imaginary but but they're more important than most of us here and they're all gonna be around long after we're dead so in a way those things are more realer than any of us
abort the sequence
so kyle imaginary things are real huh guess that means i did win the bet after all and you know what that means kyle
just let it go with your fucking balls you fucking asshole your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet well i've decided cartman even if we had a bet that i am never sucking your balls  you got that they can throw me in jail for the rest of my life but i am  never going to suck your balls  never so  there
what happened why hasn't the missile gone off
there's been an abort mr gore
no manbearpig has to die
oh jesus no
that's it aslan the evil characters have fled
the day is ours
kyle
fellas where'd you come from
what is that
huh
he did it
oh look i'm back
nice going kid
the evil characters they're all behind the wall again
dude how did you do that butters
well i just used my imagination
awwww
you know i really have learned a lot you guys what kyle said about imaginary things being real and butters using his imagination it makes me think that well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality   why look it's me and  and there's kyle and what's kyle about to do
cartman don't
ohoo kyle what are you doing to my balls oho look it's kyle sucking my balls

oh okay cool
you've got real potential kid i have no doubt you can break a million

i think you could but uh as for your friend well to be honest i think he's holding you back
what you mean kyle
look you score a lot higher than him there's no question who the better one is i wanna put you with some other players find a partner for you who can really help you max your score
but kyle and i always play together we both chipped in for the game system
very honorable but you know where loyalty gets you in a game like guitar hero nowheres just listen to that video crowd  i haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time you've got a chance to score a million points and i hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings
you're gonna love this kid stan he's one of the best guitar hero players i've ever seen except for you of course  ah thad  stan marsh this is thad jarvis
sup
that here has backed up a lot of really great guitar hero players isn't that right thad
yup
he doesn't even need a game system to play on he can play guitar hero acoustically
yeah but can he play buckethead on expert level
go ahead thad show him what you can do  check this out  pretty damn good huh

i guess i didn't realize it was just about the points
dude this game rules
let's just do this all right
hey you're the kid i sold the guitar hero game to how are you likin' it
it's okay i guess but i need some game guides for it my manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where i'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and i'm i'm stressing out
yeah guitar hero can be pretty stressful but you know maybe instead of a game guide you should just buy another game to kind of ease the stress
huh
have you ever heard of  heroin hero
heroheroin hero
ihit's a way easier game all you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin you could call it the ultimate firstperson shooter
and there's no score no crowds
no man all you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon but you don't ever catch the dragon you just keep chasing it
chase me come on this way shoot up and then you can catch me come on
dude this is awesome
how are they coming
no worries mr hart they'll be ready for the big show in a few days

fellas fellas it's ohmygod you're not gonna believe this
dude butters calm down
okay  okay i was talking to pete wetchney and he said that danny chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest
so who do they say is the cutest
i donno
who do they say is the ugliest
i don't know ih it's like a girl thing they won't let anybody see the list but them
they can't do that who are they to judge us on how we look
yeah you think they rate us just for looks or they take personality into account
if it's just looks then i think i'm safe
you guys who cares if the girls make some stupid list girls make dumb lists all the time
yeah kyle's right screw it we have better things to worry about
you're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list
oh please i don't think so craig chicks think i'm way hotter than you
you don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom
no because people know i'm not fat i'm buff they probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth or kenny cause' he's poor
they didn't put me at the bottom did they
kenny face it girls don't wanna pop tarts for dinner every night when they get married
you don't think they said i'm the ugliest boy in the class do ya well if they did my parents will ground me
you guys do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks
all right bebe let's see the list
what
you know what i'm talking about bitch the list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class
that's not for boys to look at it's a secret girl list and you can't see it
craig is on the bottom right or is it kenny 'cause you'd be eating pop tarts for dinner if you married him
i'm not  telling and anyway i'm not the list keeper nelly is and nelly will never let you look at it so there
fuck you bebe fuck you bitch
well i guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls
screw that dude we're guys we can outthink them
all right here's what we know that chick nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list right she apparently keeps it in a purple pee chee folder and we need a plan to get it from her  this is what i call operation cannot possibly fail
neato
at  pm tomorrow nelly will have to walk from home ec to social studies that's our best time to strike as she makes her way through hallway  craig will be ready with a distraction device here  when she stops and turns to craig in the hallway butters will run up and kick her in the balls
okay
once butters kicks her in the balls she'll fall to the floor dropping the pee chee and kenny will swoop in from corridor delta and grab the pee chee are we good
ow what'dja do that for  hey what's your problem asshole
bail bail
okay our mission failed but we've learned a lot primarily that girls do not have balls
they sure don't
never mind because we are going to plan b one that i call operation cannot possibly fail a second time when nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground
you think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies
butters we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now pay attention
we got it we got it
we got the list from the girls

dude kyle can you hear me they totally think i'm hotter than you are  kyle kyle i'm more attractive  kyle
clyde it's time to be getting to bed
hey what's goin' on  what's goin on hey  oh yeah hey whassup what's goin' on nice
hey what's goin' on
hey clyde
hey
hi clyde
what's goin' on
hey ugly
hey kyle look man it doesn't matter what people think okay  you know abraham lincoln was pretty ugly too but look what he accomplished  chin up cowboy  hey what's goin' on
oh not much just hanging around
hehehe hey nice nice ears haha pizza face
butters that's not cool man  he can't help how he looks
kyle i was going to suggest that maybe you should hang out with the other ugly kids in the school because if you hang out with them you won't stand out so much right  cool
hey
hello
are you going to eat your pickle
could somebody toss the football back its over there next to the ugly kids
i hate coming to this school it makes me angry
yeah
sometimes i just want to burn it down burn the whole school down to the ground
no you know what screw this we aren't ugly
we're not
no maybe we all just need a little image change you know like a makeover
hey yeah
like you maybe you just need to let your hair down and let's see how you look without those glasses  let's just put those back on
i know that song is so awesome
uh wendy could i talk to you
of course stan
just for a minute over here
you think he's gonna beg her to come back to him
this is a nice surprise i thought you were never speaking to me again
yeah well i wanna talk to you about this list you girls made
which one we make lists all the time
the one where you rated the boys' looks in the class look it really messed kyle up okay how could you vote him the ugliest
look personally i didn't vote him the ugliest my vote was for eric cartman but enough of the other girls must have felt he was
so it wasn't unanimous maybe you can just change the list
change the list do you have any idea what that would take maybe you don't understand how important listmaking is to girls it's just not something we do flippantly there's protocol
can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted kyle last
all right i'll try and get you into our next listmaking meeting but it won't be easy
today's list meeting is called to order rebecca you have the floor
if it pleases and sparkles i suggest we continue deliberations on list d which girl has the cutest purse
rebecca moves we work on list d does that sparkle with all the girls
sunshine
deliberating which girl has the cutest purse millie has the floor
if it pleases and sparkles i would like to submit that  jennifer's purse is by far the cutest definitely cuter than teresa's
i don't think anyone here disagrees that jennifer's purse is cuter than teresa's but it doesn't make it the cutest
the committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the top  cutest purses
sunshine sparkle wendy has the floor
if it pleases and sparkles i would like to suggest that we  that we reopen last week's list for debate
what'd she say she's gotta be kidding
is she crazy
all right all right come before the rainbow railing
go ahead
aaah i was just thinking that maybe you voted a little hastily on the cutest boy
you thought you should be number one
no
let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee
he didn't mean that he was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion
i cannot by sparkle law move to have an old list investigated however if you can find recourse for such an inquiry wendy i would review it does that sparkle with all the girls
sunshine
they all laugh at me  and the girls giggle behind my back  unable to even glance at my disfigured face
do not burn down the school kyle
who said that
i did  do you know who i am
abraham lincoln
i am abraham lincoln burning down the school will not solve your problems you think you've been cheated because you are ugly but i am here to show you otherwise come there is much to see  i want you to look in here  this woman is nancy pinkerton as a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school her life as a youth was filled with praises and everything being handed to her boys told her she was special she was funny she was interesting but that's only because she was hot it wasn't until she reached age  when her looks started to fade that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special as a wet carrot  this is the home of your new ugly friend yamal  because he's ugly he gets nothing handed to him he has to work at making something of himself but that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult he will have character something that kids who are hot rarely develop like your classmate clyde  now that he knows he's goodlooking he doesn't have to make any effort to be special
naw rebecca's just a friend i wanna be with you now sure yeah i'll buy you some shoes too
now his life will be about girls chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes he will most likely marry very young and not realize until age  that he's a total douche and so you see kyle it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed
but i can't wait to be an adult to be happy that's forever from now
you must be patient
just take me home i don't wanna be here anymore take me home
very well
kyle you need to think about what i've told you
i don't want to i don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore
well then you're just a fucking asshole
wait a minute wait stan i think i've got something  take a look at this during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy seven girls gave clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle
i have no idea what you're talking about
it doesn't add up it is possible that rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list
oh hey wendy
hey rebecca do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks
oho wendy we're done with that list
i know but i think there's been a mistake six of the girls i've talked to didn't vote clyde the cutest that means that mathematically he should have been
all right you need to stop digging around wendy  you might not like what you find  just back off and stop asking questions  you're getting close to a secret that i don't think you can handle let it go
that didn't sparkle with her did it
one canister of propane six cans of lighter fluid  seven gallons of highoctane kerosene and a box of matches  okay is that everything little boy
that should just about do it
do you like to put this on your truevalue card today
nonorary chair mrs secretary i believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists i've compiled a full report and it turns out that nobody voted claude the cutest in the class i believe rebecca changed the list to make him number one
why would she do that
right after the list was made rebecca started going out with clyde you can read all the discrepancies here  we need to remake that list
you just couldn't let it go
uh what do you mean call the girls in
i'm afraid we can't do that wendy
did you know wendy that clyde's father own the shoe store at the mall a lot of us have always wanted to date clyde to get free shoes but we couldn't because he wasn't popular enough
you knew
unfortunately the members voted clyde in the bottom five of the list that's why we had to manipulate the votes forge a new list and hide the real one
so that you all could justify dating clyde and get shoes how dare you take advantage of your position i'm gonna tell bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee
bebe who do you think authorized the buyout
no not bebe
she's dating clyde now nobody loves shoes more than her
what's going on
when the other girls find out you ignored their votes they're gonna
do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee we'll simple generate a new list biggest liars and put you at the top
do yourself a favor wendy just let it go and keep your little mouth shut
i don't think so
aagh
stan run
jesus dude
hey kid have you seen kyle we've looked everywhere and we have to show him something
he's burning down the school
what
he said he gonna burn the school down to the ground
all the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over are you happy now god you made me look like this
kyle kyle don't
don't try and stop me stan you don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity
the list was a forgery kyle
huh
it didn't sparkle with all the girls we have the real list
that's about far enough  give me that list wendy
stan what is going on
it was about shoes kyle the girls wanted shoes so they set you up
kyle was simple a casualty to move clyde meant that craig has to be moved to number twelve which moved jimmy down and moved jason up
so what number was i
you've compromised everything our lists' integrity
did you seeee these shoes wendy  they're incredible
it doesn't matter how incredible they are you can't oh my god those are amazing
right
is that a lace across the top
no it's a little strap
wendy
oh but it doesn't matter you took it too far
if you hadn't gone all nancy drew on us this would have just gone away
she's gonna kill us
it's too late bebe i've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police people will know
oh please you're lying
give it up bebe we know all about it the list was compromised kyle broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class
wendy
aah
wait i i didn't do anything wrong
you can explain all that downtown
here kyle  we've been through a lot but you can finally see where you really are on the list
are you sure you're okay with this kyle
i'm sure abe lincoln was right i don't wanna find out i'm goodlooking and become a total shithead when i grow up
abe lincoln
stan it's been really great hanging out with you again i feel like you've changed somehow in a really awesome way
yeah well i guess a lot of things change don't they  bwaaaagh bwaaaagh
line
ahhhhhh
well there's no doubt about it those tonsils need to come out
what
uh what exactly does that entail doctor
it's a very simple operation we'll just put you to sleep eric and when you wake up you'll be tonsilfree
no no way i'm not going to the hospital mom
oh i thought you were a tough kid you're not scared of hospitals are you
no i'm not scared i just i don't want my tonsils out that's all
well then i guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery either
ice cream
it'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals
what do you say champ think you can tough it out
wellyou did say free ice cream
poopsiekins wake up wake up honey
uh it's over
that's right you did it poopsiekins
its over i didn't feel anything you were right mom
i'm so proud of you eric
all right so where's my ice cream
oh here's the doctors now hi doctor
you were right doctor everything is okay
no it's not eric i'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the aids virus
what
what's that supposed to mean
during the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood a mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with hiv it was a one in a billion fluke
i have aids
not yet but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes aids we are very sorry
sorry you gave me aids and you're sorry
oh my poor little baby
mom you said nothing would go wrong
oh god  oh no
no no this is a joke right this is a joke i can't have aids
we're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you eric for starters i think i owe you some ice cream
fuck your ice cream you said i'd be fine you all said i'd be fine
oh oh my baby has hiv
no noooooooo
thank you for coming everyone
boys please take a seat
what's going on are we in trouble
boys the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends has a serious illness eric cartman has been diagnosed with hiv
what
oh no
he's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion the disease is in very early stages and completely manageable but he's naturally a bit scared
cartman has hiv
we need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from eric you can still give him hugs and even kisses don't be afraid of him just
excuse me eric cartman has hiv
all right we're going to bring eric in now and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love okay
eric come on in your friends want to say hi m'kay
no way
how ya doin' eric you know i think you're a real special little guy and even though you have aids i ain't gonna act any different towards you
god damn it this sucks ass
excuse me i have to step out for a minute
poor kyle he's really taking it hard
is kyle laughing out there this isn't a time for funny jokes i'm gonna die
no you're not going to die eric aids isn't as big a deal as it used to be there are advances in treatment and
not a big deal is that how everyone feels people need to understand the seriousness of this illness and the bravery of the people who struggle with it
we are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with hiv
where the hell is everybody
excuse me shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started
this is everyone we didn't sell that many tickets
great benefit eric
the italian meatballs are fafantastic
so this is it
i'm afraid aids benefits aren't as popular as they used to be aids was more the 's's disease it's all about cancer now
well that's just great of all the times to get aids i get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap
with all of your help we have raised over seventeen dollars for aids tonight and that money will certainly go towards helping little eric markman
just bring out elton john already
uh we're sorry elton couldn't make it he uh he had to play at a cancer benefit
it's all right we got somebody better jimmy buffett
jimmy buffett
hello everyone i wrote this song for a very brave little boyaidsburger in paradiseaidsburger and it ain't nice
nobody likes jimmy buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the south
a little boy in south parkdyin' of aids in the cold darkhow he got aids i haven't a cluewastin' away again because of aids and stuffhow are we all feelin' tonight
fuck you jimmy buffett you fuckin' suck
ohoho poopsiekins be nice
fuck you mom i have fucking aids
hey guys thanks a lot for comin' to my aids benefit yesterday
oh dude was that yesterday we forgot
yeah you forgot just like a lot of people lately have forgot that aids is still killing people seems like all of america has forgot that hiv is a serious disease
well did elton john sing a song for you
no as a matter of fact jimmy buffett came instead  oh yeah it's real fuckin' funny kyle
i'm sorry i'm i'm really cartman i fi feel really bad for you honestly

i do
if you really felt bad you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face  well any god damned second kyle
i'm sorry i gotta go home
jesus christ can you believe that asshole
he does feel bad for you cartman he just thinks it's ironic
ironic how
well you know you're always such a dick and stuff and and now
oh and what i deserve it is that what you think
not me that's uh kinda what he thinks
nobody deserves this illness stan kenny nobody it's awful and maybe somebody needs to teach kyle how to have some compassion
oh uhokay it's clear
all right get that rope ready to hoist me up
okay but what are you going to do
kyle thinks that hiv is funny so we're gonna make him look funny and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at
i just uh well i don't know if i should be helping you make kyle look silly
butters helping people who have aids is one of the most important things you can do
i know but are you sure kyle has to be taught a lesson
i'm not just sure butters i'm hivpositive
oh yeah uhwell i guess that's true
all right now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window that's the easiest access
wow you really know what you're doing
yeah i've sneaked into kyle's room lots of times  you think hiv is something to be laughed at kyle well  let's just see how funny it is now asshole
wagh
there there bubbe you'll be okay  oh doctor did you find anything is it strep
no it isn't strep
oh well there's a relief
mrs broflovski has your son ever had a blood transfusion
no why
little boy have you been having unprotected anal sex
what no
doctor what are you saying
we've run every test imaginable little kyle here is infected with hiv
what
hiv
it took us a long time to narrow it down but there is no doubt
no that's impossible
little boy are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice
no no god damn it no i'm telling you you're wrong there there's no way i can have hiv unless maybe  oh my god that son of a bitch

that's right i think you owe kyle an apology
i'm sorry

that's better and now kyle maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling

what hope
break my xbox and you'll never know
you're lying
no noal all right kyle magic johnson kyle the key is magic johnson
magic johnson
he was a basketball player
so what
so he got hiv like fifty years ago and he's still totally fine magic johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus kyle i've been researching it since i got infected if we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype we have a chance of beating this thing buddy  you and me kyle we can overcome our illness i swear it to you
you better 'cause if you don't find a cure for hiv i will break your xbox
my god
we need two tickets to los angeles as soon as possible
los angeles okay uh i have a two o'clock flight that would beee  each
ah sir you don't understand we have to see magic johnson right away you see we have aids
aids wow that's really retro but ah i'm sorry i i just can't give away free seats
don't you get it we are two pals afflicted with an illness and who only have each other in a race against time innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason
oh please no reason i got aids from him
oh you boys are  like that huh
no
are you sure you boys just don't have any cash
we're not just sure we're hivpositive
uh we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients but aids i d hehhey mitch do we have any aids patient policies
forget it all right we'll use another airline one that cares
we're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys what kind of cancer did you say you have again
oh uh you know all over cancer
i'm so sorry
yeah well at least  it's not as bad as having aids aids is the worst disease
hm i don't know these days i think i'd rather have aids than cancer
no you wouldn't look shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something get outta here  we're on our way buddy  magic johnson here we come
don't touch me
i know i'm scared too
magic magic could you come to the front for a minute there are a couple of boys here to see you two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across america to find the cure for aids all they have are each other in a race against time
thank you for seeing us mr johnson we were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease
you boys both have the virus are you sure
we're not just sure we're hivpositive
will you stop it with that what part of this is funny to you
kyle we need to try to find a
what part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny
i don't think it's funny kyle
then stop saying you're not just sure you're hivpositive  this isn't funny aids isn't funny dying isn't funny so shut the fuck up
well excuse me kyle for trying to keep some optimism you know i mean sometimes when things seem their darkest you just need to try and stay hivpositive but if you wanna be so hivnegative all the time i
knock it off right now this isn't funny at all
are you sure
yes
are you hivpositive  aarrhh ow fuck kyle
boys the truth is i don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus i would love to know so i could help others but i just don't
well i've been thinking maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders hiv from growing do you mind if we just look around
well not at all
the pool is over there  where i try to swim and stay in shape my kitchen  is full of pretty healthy food i don't know which thing it is that keeps my tcell count high so i try it all
but everyone tries that there has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't could we see where you sleep
sure
just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom
dude
oh oh yeah i i don't trust banks i sleep with all my money
you sleep with money every night
yeah i like to keep it close b you don't think that
it's incredible mitch these boys could be onto something take a look  that's a sample of hivinfected blood you can clearly see the hiv attacking the white blood cells right  all right watch what happens when we introduce some cash
my god the hiv particles are receding
the cash does seem to retrain the hiv cells from stabilizing
now hold on all the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus not destroying it
well look if being around lots of cash negatively affects the hiv then maybe
then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether
i have enough cash for all three of us we should give it a try
nanoo it's ridiculous we need fda approval control studies i'm sorry but this is impossible
these boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen  their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illnessridden lives
their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world that's for sure
wugh
i suppose we could try to distill magic's cash down to its most highlyconcentrated level and try it on one of them but it's very risky
yeah well if there's a chance of being cured of this illness then kyle is willing to take that risk
let's hope to christ this works
wait a minute yes yes take a look  the cash particles have completely replaced all the hiv in kyle's blood  boys you just found the cure for aids
all right
they found the cure for aids  the cure for aids
what is it
large doses of concentrated cash  get the media on the phone
all right
scientists have just discovered the cure for aids  about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream
hey they just found the cure for aids you just have to inject yourself with all your cash woohoo
i am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the hiv virus in either kyle broflovski or eric cartman  together these boys beat their illness with nothing but each other and overcoming all odds  these two brave friends
oh stop we're not friends he's the one who infected me with aids
these two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world and so to honor these boys  here is jimmy buffett
what aw no
cureburger in paradisecureburger there i said it twice
what aw god damn it  well i'll tell you this kyle i'm never gettin' my tonsils out again hahahaha
i'm still breaking your xbox
what no no  kyle no

a distraught britney spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her a local housewife caught a photo of britney running away in this disguise
britney is obviously very upset about her mtv performance ron and so she's become desperate most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe

little stanley was tired and hungry but he knew that for britney spears to be safe he had to get her to the north pole
you doing okay ms spears
it's her um no i'm sure it's britney spears  it looks just like the picture  you want me to to what yes i understand  rectus hoc honebus
hello i'm bob summers so happy you picked our little town
what is going on why do you want britney spears to die
well nobody wants her to die little boy we all simply need her to do you understand
no
look kid throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in human sacrifice
in ancient times humans would commonly pick one lovely girl adorn her with jewels treat her like a goddess and then watch her die
we like to think we're more civilized now but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times
only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs
it's a damn shame too old ways were bettah used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death
stonin' to death was too violent rather have the sacrifice kill itself
you mean everyone has been wanting britney spears to kill herself
britney was chosen a long time ago to be built up and adored and then sacrificed for harvest
all right everyone's about here
who's everyone who all is in on this
hey where are we this isn't right
oh no
ohhh thoooo
come on britney  come on come on
mom dad  they're gonna kill her they're going to in wait what are you doing here
it's okay kyle just be a good boy
be a good boy you know all about this
kyle what the fuck is going on now
she's been built up to be sacrificed stan
sacrificed for what
for harvest stanley same reason we've always done it
sacrifice in march corn have plenty starch
corn harvest
we haven't told you about it stanley because we we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest
all right enough already this has all gone on long enough
the kid is right this has gone on too long
yeah she was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago
and harvest is coming soon
all right folks let's finish this quickly
no wait
come on hurry up
i can't run you go ahead i'll catch up with ya
here davey
hold on
she's dead
well i think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone
mornin' bill
mornin' gil
nicelookin' corn
hey sharon randy great harvest huh
an incredible harvest some of the best corn i've seen in years
she's the daughter of a country singer and the young girl has really taken the country by storm hannah montana's miley cyrus though only fifteen years old is already on her way to being a major superstar
hey check it out
looks like next harvest will be even better
m'kay kids we have something very serious we need to discuss today hm'kay it appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves some kids call it the choking game hm'kay but but choking yourself is bad hm'kay don don't do that hm'kay
you can get high from choking yourself
schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high hm'kay like sniffin' glue guzzlin' cough medicine huffin' paint hm'kay but they're all bad m'kay
mmmy cousin's in florida and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee
cat pee
that's not true you can't get high off of cat urine can you
well it's a it's not actually cat urine but male cats when they're marking their territory uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and aand that could get you really high m'kay rereally reeeally high okay  probably shoushouldn't have told you that just now hm'kay tha that was probably bad
all right this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine  yesss poor mr kitty are you just so upset right now
you guys are wasting your time
yeah this is not gonna work
okay ready kenny
all set
all right bring out the other male cat
ow
whoa
do you feel anything
well kenny are you buzzed
hey cool check it out
i see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits
yeahhh
then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of varnov appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds
okay

ah kenny
dude dude kenny calm down
oh i was so close you should have seen those titties
what titties
the titties oh my god they were incredible
kenny all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering
yeah and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes
i almost touched them
dude i don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore
next on fox news  it's the newest drug craze and it's killing your kids
killing our kids
all over america kids are getting high on cat urine  huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state  and is also referred to as cheesing  why cheesing because it's fon to due  this sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months
we sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named  goes and gets her cats and we'll just cheese all day long
oh my god sheila come look at this
so how can you tell if your child is cheesing  your child seems distant preoccupied your child's face smells like cat urine when you see tigers at the zoo your child starts grinding his or her teethyou might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends such as hey let's go cheese or do you feel like cheesing guys or dude i'm cheesing my fing brains out right now
kids are doing this
kids do it because it's legal  what can you do before it's too late
we have to protect our children from this sheila
twenty percent of american students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once kids also refer to it as the cheese game or vitamin cheese or mary jane piss in your face fun time cheesing is spreading fast
all right we're all sufficiently scared gerald but what could we do
i have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of south park
gerald's right we all have to face it cats are deadly animals if you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss they can kill you
with my super lawyer powers we can rid our town of cats so that our kids can never get high again
let's hear it for gerald
hooray for gerald
no no
oh wah wah get over it druggie  jeez
goodbye scrambles  we'll miss you
got two here

first thing is we've gotta dispose of this

i'd better just take it down to the basement for now mmake sure kyle can't find it
no no what am i thinking i shouldn't do this  i've been clean for ten years i haven't even been near a cat  but then that report said our kids were doing it too and and i knew kyle would have the same sicknesses i used to have now a cat is in our home and it's too tempting  i i'll just do it one more time  one last time  then i'll call the police have them pick up the cat  and then i'll never do it again  after this one last time
i couldn't stay away curse your rockin' tits
who is it
please open the door  they say you are hiding cats
hiding cats  why that would be illegal
you don't understand  my little nishka  she has nowhere else to go
oh oh no no i cannot possibly take in another
but they will find him
i've already taken in the andersons' cats and the willinskys' there's simply nothinng else i can  then again perhaps i could find space for just this one more

what are you doing with cats in your attic fatass
they're innocent victims in this kyle they have to hide or they'll be put to death something you just can't understand
come on we've gotta find kenny before he hurts himself

you're too young for this stuff
this must be decided at the breastriary in nippopolis
now fight for the locnar trophy
dad dad what the hell are you doing
they've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes
she's mine you little asshole
get the fuck off of me
gerald
the key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park gerald broflovski is prepared to give a public statement
i would like to address a personal matter i have let myself down and i would first like to apologize to my lovely wife
don't touch me
and to the people of south park  i was wrong and i can't let cats take the fall anymore it's our fault the people who use cats for their sweet urine  we have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it sure you get to fight in the breastriary and swim in the fountains of varnov with the itty titty fairies of mammary mountain
what the hell is he talking about
i have no idea
and then you fight the boob goblin in the gazongas cave and then the girl may thank you for it but she isn't real
and you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway
problem is the more you into that world the more you need to go until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you
yeah i guess so
cats aren't the problem we made cats illegal and and then i cheesed for the first time in ten years and kids are always gonna find a new way to get high like sniffing glue or licking toads or fermenting feces or huffing paint you can also look at
uh okay that's probably good gerald
the point is i was wrong its time to legalize cats  heh yeah hooray for gerald hey let's hear it for gerald
scrambles so good to have you back you ain't sore at us are ya  ahh get him off
i'm sure glad that's over with
me too
but you know we've all learned something you guys we can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding it's wrong
and you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history
mmmmmmmmmm nope i have no idea what you're talking about kyle
you guys check it out  it's kenny  isn't that great he's just getting high on life
yeah  he's getting really high on life

thought i forgot about you gopher  ughhh my brains
sweet i think we're next in line now
stephen stephen they're here they've come to negotiate
what you mean it
okay we did it
who the hell are you
we're the ones you told to get internet money
here  we made ten million theoretical dollars it's all for you
theoretical dollars what am i supposed to do with that  you little timewasters
hey we worked really hard to get this theoretical money
yeah everyone thinks i'm a homo now
you are a homo butters
dude will you just end this thing now my little brother is gonna die
nooooo i'm not gonna look like an idiot if i fucked up and led everyone astray the last thing i'm going to do and admit it  yes this is the head of the wga the world canadian bureau
ah mr abootman it's the global world summit leaders we want to talk to you about the strike
you you do you wanna negotiate
no actually we were just wondering if when you're all dead we can use newfoundland for a new global theme park
hello will you just give this guy something please
excuse me
he just doesn't wanna look like an idiot so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something just just give him anything
well we could give canada some small consolation prize
if they give you something small will you end the strike
will they act like they're giving canada a lot so everyone thinks i did a good job
can you act like you're giving him a lot
sure why not
we have won
well how much did we get
well we uh we didn't get everything that we wanted but we negotiated hard and we got these  coupons to bennigan's and  free bubblegum for every canadian  these coupons entitle every canadian to a free meal at bennigan's with the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value of course
we did it
my friends this is the greatest victory in canadian history
ike ike  it's over
it's over
yeah here you go
boy i'm sure glad that's over with
me too
yeah but you know i learned something today we thought we could make money on the internet but while the internet is new and exciting for creative people it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue it will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media
yeah

mr gar mr garrison  could we speak with you please

ohhh it's so easy for you mackey you have a penis
ooookay students um obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher so uh while we deal with this we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz

and so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure in other news tonight a south park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice this picture of a mouse  genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest
what
but the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses
holy freaking jesus
using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop here's the mouse you saw on television  once the ear fully forms it can be transplanted onto a person
doctor what about a penis
well a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina
no no if i gave you some of my dna could you grow a penis on a mouse for me
you don't understand doing this stuff is very expensive and we've never tried a penis before there's no guarantee it would work
i will give you all the money i have to just try please doctor i'm a man trapped in a woman's body i need a penis
all right  all right let's see what we can do
eric we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher
ey don't commend me it's the students' fault for being so stupid
uh commend means you've done a great job eric hm'kay
after leading your class through review your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests whatever you did really worked on them
oh well thank you i believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning
these gentlemen from the denver county school board have something they want to ask you
young man word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking we would like you to try your methods on one of our innercity school classes
these kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and since you handled your class so well how would you like to give it a shot
that sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most how much will you pay me
three hundred bucks did you hear what i said you guys my awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three hundred bucks
you're not an awesome teacher
whatever the whole class scored superhigh on the test
the only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of garrison's desk and you know it
yes but whose idea was it to take the answers out of garrison's desk
kenny's
yeah that was my idea
oh yeah but whatever i'm gonna go teach those underprivileged innercity students and really turns their lives around
do you know what those kids are going to do to you a little middleclass white boy telling them what to do they are going to fucking murder you
maybe he's right i'd better be careful how i look
students quiet quiet please  give me your attention
i'll give you my attention all night long mrs miller
you're on thin ice rodriguez now listen up the denver county school board has sent over a special guest teacher
ohhhhhhhhhhh
this may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all i want you to welcome eric cartmanez
hello students i'm eric cartmanez  your new teacher
what the hell is thiiis
i am here to teach you calculuuus
iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress ms garrison
mr garrison
sorry mister garrison your dna has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse and so here's your penis
wow my penis looks great
yes it's a fantastic penis congratulations
how long before it's ready
welll it still has some forming to do but fairly soon
let me see if it feels right in my hand
no don't open the
whoa no
don't let it get out of the lab
mah penis  stop penis come back here
okay everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu
hey man what the hell do you think you're doing
yeahhhh
mr cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
getting into college maaan we ain't gettin' in no college fuck you
how do i reach these keeds  the reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught how to cheat properly how do you think white people always get ahead because we cheat all the time i mean because they cheat all the time  this is bill beelichick coach of the new england patriots he's won three super bowls how he cheated he even got caught cheating and nobody cared bill beelichick proved that in america it's okay to cheat as long as you cheat your way to the top
hey i don't wanna be called a cheater
no no if you cheat and fail you're a cheater if you cheat and succeed you're savvyyy
this is bullshit i don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat
go ahead the door's right there  byebye have fun we will miss youuu  how do i reach these keeds
boys boys have you seen my penis
what
my penis is on the loose if you see it just try to catch it with some cheese
ow that hurt my brains  oww
nice form compadre
hey i walked out of your class teacher look i don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating
who wants to argue on a nice day like theees how about a little pickup game  hey paisanoo can you keep score for us
sure thing mr c
okay you start on defense amigo
aaaah
ohoooh that's one to nothing amigo
you cheated
what's the score ese okay let's go your turn  that's two to nothing amigoo
fuck you man you can't do that
look at the scoreboard amigo no matter how many times you say i cheated the scoreboard says two nothing
i know what you're trying to say but i still don't agree with it
two to nothing ese two to nothing  how do i reach these keeds
what is that  eeeek eeeek  eeeek eeeek  stephen stephen come quick
what is it dear
a penis is loose in our kitchen
a penis
yes it just ran across the floor
now darling calm down
calm down nothing i don't want that penis running through my house
hoh women always afraid of penises
there there you see it
oh it's just a little penis darling
i don't care it's probably got all kinds of diseases
hey wait i think that's teacher's penis
your teacher's penis
yeah that must be his
butters how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like
huh
today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat getting material ahead of time  when bill beelichick cheated for the patriots what did he do he videotaped the opposing team's defense think of the defense as your test when taking a test you must also videotape the defense learn what's on the test before they give it to you and that way you can
i thought that well maybe i can give cheating a try
have a seat amigo good to have you baaack  all right now when bill beelichick got caught with his camera he did not panic he simply said what every good white cheater says when caught i misinterpreted the rules it's what you must also say when caught cheating i misinterpreted the rules say it with me
i misinterpreted the rules
good again
i misinterpreted the rules
again
i misinterpreted the rules
now you sound like white people
i misinterpreted the rules
what the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside why didn't you call me
look garrison my wife didn't want a penis in the house i had to get it out
well now how am i supposed to find it it could be anywhere
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek
holy crap
eeeek eeeeeek
carole get down from there
noo didn't you see that penis just now eeeek
i'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it
you saw a penis
eeeeeeeek
oh it's so big and disguuusting eeek
come back here penis  there you are got you  hey you're not my penis  ogh  there it goes stop you
the answer to  is
the answer to  is
the answer to  is
the answer to  is
man what's the point  what's the point of any of this
all right uh everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal i'll be right back  melita melita hold on  you can't quit now come on what's wrong with you
there isn't any point to all this i won't be going to college i'm pregnant all right i just found out and eduardo isn't going to help me raise it
how do i reach these keeds  all right let's go get you an abortion
no i'm catholic i think abortion is wrong
abortion isn't wrong what's the one thing i've been teaching you
that cheating is good
yes and abortion is the ultimate form of cheating you're cheating nature itself  why do rich white girls get ahead in life because they get abortionnns when they're young they get pregnant but they still want to go to college so whatever they just cheat they cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life
i don't know mr c
mexicans are told not to cheat don't cheat you got pregnant you have to raise the child so then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns  it is at our most challenging times that we must cheat our very hardest
and the last time you saw your penis was two days ago
that's right
long whiskers or short
short and little fluffy ears
fluffy ears okay
think you got it mitch
i think so sir is this pretty close
no no not like that that's just silly
sir we might wanna get a unit down to the italian restaurant on kentner
what is it
call just came through seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese
wall come on
eek
what's the matter
a penis
a penis where
there it is  eek
where is it
look there
come on
what'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen
huy don't you dare kill my penis  crap we've gotta go back around
someone somewhere is loving me tonightlooking at the same moon and seeing it so bright
someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
feelin' my despair
and this same moon is
making them think of that
there it is  no nooo  no no
there's not a chance now
no we we can find it
sorry garrison your penis is gone afraid there's nothing more we can do you'll just have to live with being a woman a very ugly one come on men
students i want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores the school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit  the test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating
uh what
the test will be tomorrow make us proud
monitor us in a private room
now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along
i knew it man you made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing
ih it's not for nothing ih if you're good enough you can cheat right in front of them
shut up man you reyally screwed us all
how do i reeeach these keeeeds  just before the last super bowl bill beelichick gathered his football players and said let's win this one for real just this one time let's not cheat you know what happened  they lost  even if you feel all eyes are upon you you cannot give up on cheating or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives
yeah come on we can do this guys
you are the true dreamers tomorrow you will prove it we will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water
you did this to yourself garrison get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis  well what the  why it's my penis  my penis came back but why  i guess it's true what's that old saying if you love your penis let it go
the standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country twentyfour of our students took the test and all twentyfour scored
uh can we say something
sure
we would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the white people method mr cartmanez
i reeached these keeeds
students and faculty please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back mister garrison
thanks everyone it's great to be back i'm a man again thanks to my very special new friend  but you know i've learned that i've really been a dude all along because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies if you can't have babies then you're a man

and so what have we learned through this ordeal the internet went away it came back but for how long we do not know we cannot take the internet for granted any longer we as a country must stop overlogging on we must use the internet only when we need it it's easy for us to think we can just use up all the internet we want but if we don't treat the internet with the respect  that it deserves it could one day be gone forever so let us learn to live with the internet not for it no more browsing for no apparent reason no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television and finally  we must learn to only use the internet for porn twice a day max

no if we don't leave right now we're gonna miss the bus and then they'll know we left
huh i guess you're right butters all right come on
set up the satellite relay check for alternate routes out of the area  unfortunately your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us that is unfortunate for you because when i think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination
please if you must take anyone don't take me these kids are worth more to you
how did they find us
get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building
all right men listen up looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here they've got the employees and some school kids held hostage
tucker dylan set up a perimeter
everyone stay on your toes these are professionals we're dealing with here
what did they rob sir
a burger king
all right good is that all of it
no don't forget we've got these too
excellent now listen everyone we're going to be all right this is only a small hitch in our plan  i'd like to speak with the chief of police  who is this this is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants
why aren't the cops coming in
they must be negotiating
them there bandits sure look mighty strange and them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots
will you shut up
wait you have guns here
sure sheriff got lots of rifles in his office
well why don't you go get them and bring them back here
all righty come on storehand
yeppir
uhaw man i can't wait to see the look on kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time while he was at the dumb pioneer village
we're not telling anybody i don't wanna get in trouble and i didn't have a super fun time anyways
butters you've gotta learn to chill life goes by pretty fast if you don't stop and look around once in a while and do whatever you want all the time you could miss it
yeah well i guess that's kinda true
uh oh  crap they called the cops on us
what they called the cops
they must have realized we left damn
oh my god the police are looking for us
shhh butters
we're gonna get it now
butters butters calm down i know a way out of this
you just got me busted forever
butters llisten to me listen
no
all we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us then we can say we were inside all along
you said they wouldn't notice we were gone you promised
if we sneak back inside we can say we never left all right  all right now let go of my hand
no
butters
huh you made me break one rule i'm not breaking the other it's all i have now
all right come on
keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts everyone check in at twominute intervals i hope you have good news ohrlich
the police have us completely surrounded on all sides there's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted
above ground
look i found this at the rear of the park it's an old mine shaft  but pioneer village was sued when a kid died in it so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock
so if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police excellent
one more thing frans i want my share of the take now
what's the matter ohrlich lose your sense of trust
i was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel then you take the loot to berlin and i never see you again i want my cut
very well
i'm going to ask you again what is the door code to the tunnel
i told you mister what would i know about a door code i'm just a simple blacksmith with my trusty forge i makes all the metalworks for the village  ow
you are an employee here that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons  mister david palmer of colorado springs
huh my name ain't palmer it's old smithy hand we ain't never heard of no fire code why we gots to put fires out ourselves when the  ow
that's it  tell me the code or you die  one two
i
yes
i don't know nothin' about no fancy door code i'm just a simple blacksmith
these pioneer village workers are really committed to their jobs
no please don't hurt me
give us the code to that door and we can leave
i've never heard of ssssomething called a door code  please can't you ask some other way
i don't have time for your stupid game tell me or you die right now
all right all right look it's just it's just one of those jenkins home security locks you press the top button and then and then enter
what he meant to say kids is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time we gots to rely on wood locks and sich
god damn it you people are fucking insane
i don't believe it
domino  walsky find out if there are any employees or students wandering about bring them here or shoot them

i was diagnosed seven years ago cancer is pure evil it is a fat little lump that needs to be destroyed  when there is a cancer you have to fight it you can't reason with cancer you can't wish it away cancer doesn't play by the rules so neither can you
my parents said that if i fight
and you can't listen to what anybody else tells you  you have to be willing to give up everything because the cancer will  take everything do you understand

ladies and gentlemen our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions i'm talking of course about peruvian flute bands  the red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of peruvian flute bands are all over the world wherever there are tourists or shoppers there are now on average  peruvian flute bands per square kilometer general
france japan and the northeastern united states are currently the hardest hit make no mistake  this is a pan flute epidemic
a pandemic
three countries in asia and seven in europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their peruvian flute bands we will need every resource available to see this through
excuse me but aid other countries
senator
with all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands let other countries fend for themselves
you heartless bastard this country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity and we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by peruvian flute bands is that clear  as director of homeland security i am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained
go go
ha  serves you right assholes
one more over here
let's go get 'em out
clear out move this is a homeland security operation people let's go
hey back off
make sure all pan flute music cds are contained
there's sharon and shelly they're watching some television wave to the camera shelly  what are you watching guys
the news
huh
we're watching the news
that's the tv in our living room still showing commercials right now  what do you think about the television shelly  oh the news is starting
the government efforts to stop the peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day  in cities all over the world  flute bands have been removed and quarantined  but more may still be out there homeland security's requesting that  if you see a peruvian flute band do not approach it mark down the flute band's location and do not under any circumstances buy their cds  the flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in miami
ehexcuse us hello  uh excuse me sir sir there's been a misunderstanding can can i talk to you for a minute
sir sir can we talk to you for just a second

hey craig you know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday how would you like to invest in a peruvian flute band you can double your money in one afternoon come on craig don't be an asshole
attention peruvian flute bands
atencione bandas de flauta per
we appreciate your cooperation and patience
cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado
tomorrow you will be boarding ships
maana sera el embarque de barcos
which will take you to guantanamo bay
que la lleva a viajar guantanimo
there you will spend the rest of your lives
donde pasar el resto de sus vidas gracias
guantanamo bay we can't go to guantanamo bay
don't worry you guys i'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us
please mr and mrs tucker our boys were last seen hanging out with your son craig do you have any idea where they could've gone
no i'm telling you this isn't like craig at all i'm really worried
you've checked with the police
nobody know anything it's liit's like the boys just vanished
none of the other kids have seen them since a  randy will you put that thing down what is wrong with you our son is missing
hey i'm worried about him too sharon
well then stop being an idiot and help
maybe the boys all ran away were any of your boys upset about anything
all we know is they were seen hanging out with craig and now they're gone
that's exactly why i told kyle not to hang around that boy
what is that supposed to mean
to be honest mrs tucker we think craig is bad influence on our boys
now wait just a minute
i'm just saying that your son has some problems a
like every kid doesn't have some problems
obviously craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble
oh my god
this is ridiculous
ohhh this is good
that's not ridicul
sir good news looks like we did it every major city is reporting zero peruvian flute bands we got 'em all
calm down people we still have work to do we have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again
we don't know where they came from sir we we've been researching but we can't figure it out
well think about it idiot where else would peruvian flute bands come from
hmm
the country is in the name
no sir we checked the entire map there isn't a country called peruvian anywhere
not peruvian retards peru it's right here
pehroo
now i want a plan in place to take out peru once and for all
is that really necessary sir it seems a little extreme
yeah
peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source
sir you'd better come quick one of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape
see  god damn it
the llama brothers tapas and moodscapes
this is a mistake sir we aren't really a peruvian flute band
right you just play pan flute music at the mall and sell cds of you with a llama but you're not a peruvian flute band
we we we're just kids you know we we were just trying to make some money
we just wanna go home
sir please i'm supposed to get laid for the first time on saturday
which tourist location were they playing at
an outdoor mall in colorado
look we're from colorado we we grew up in the united states
we we speak english
and we're white
let me talk to you guys out here  well what do you think
i don't know what to make of it sir it's like nothing i've ever seen before clearly they are a peruvian flute band and yet they aren't they play pan flute music like the others but they talk and act like one of us
i agree they're obviously some kind of hybrid
a hybrid ah how is that possible
perhaps a peruvian flute band mated with one of our females who knows
well however they came to be they're about the only piece of good luck we've had
sir
if they are the hybrid we're talking about  then they could be our way of taking out peru once and for all
do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you  because you're always doing stuff like this you're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something and then it backfires and then you end up in some foreign country or in outer space or something that's why no one likes hanging out with you guys
you're being extremely negative craig
all right here's the deal maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't but if you help us we'll get you home
help you how
you're able to walk amongst the peruvian flute bands they see you as one of them we are going to send you to their capital
can we please just go home sir
we still don't know whose side you're on you do this and we'll know you leave for peru in the morning
no no i'm not going to peru not peru
kyle calm down
you know i can't go there stan
one of our friends was raped in peru it was very traumatic
you don't have a choice either you go to peru or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands
thompson can you come over here  the flute band players won't shut up about something and i can't understand them
por favor no podemos ir estamos aqu para proteger a ustedes
s
s no podemos ir si protectores
they're saying something like you can't send us away we are the protectors
protectors from what
la muerte peluda la muerte peluda
what does that mean
i think he said the furry death
la muerte peluda la muerte peluda
this is cnn
the last of the peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world paul harris is at the shopping promenade and paul pretty nice not having any peruvian flute music there i suspect
really welcome silence tom there hasn't been a peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now and everyone is really enjoying the peace the world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the  what the
oh my gohhhd
ohmigod
jesus christ
aaaahhh
there's there's something else here it's  it's not a peruvian flute band it's a oh my god what is that thing
paul paul what do you see
it's furry it's very furry
okay obviously something different has uh shown up a did he say furry  okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh  my god what is that thing  aaahhh
all right we're about  kilometers from peru there'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics
was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a peruvian flute band that any of you said hey you know this plan might backfire  no that never occurred to you because you guys are jerks and you never learn from your mistakes and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes
that's not true kids at school like us don't they
yeah dude kids at school totally like us craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now
i'm being a dick
yes
you guys took my birthday money got me arrested and sent to miami with no way home except to take down the country of peru and i'm being a dick
there's no talking to this guy
all right fine craig when we get back home we'll get you your money back and we'll never talk to you again how's that
that would be great thank you
this is wrong uh this just doesn't make any sense why would homeland security send us into peru
because they're trying to take over the world
ah i don't know it just feels like there's got to be something else going on here
please i don't know where else to turn the police haven't been any help ugheh i think our boys might really be in trouble this time yes yes please check and call me right back thank you  randy i swear to god if you don't put that thing away
sharon you're gonna be really glad i have all this footage of the family someday

mr marsh you have to move it isn't safe to be here
aaaaaaaah
oh my gohhhd
go go go go back the other way
oho oh god oh god oh god  oh god  i'm  i'm so  startled
oh my gohhhd
haaa
sir we've got a bigger problem
oh and what might that be
new reports are coming in from cities all over the world word of massive destruction and death by what appear to be
guinea pigs
yes sir how did you know
you were so close to figuring it all out davis did you know that
sir
i really thought you had me in miami but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together
you you knew this was going to happen
oh this is only the beginning davis and i can't let you interfere  sorry my friend but i've worked too hard to make all this happen the pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths the guinea pigs are rising and the only person who could have stopped all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere
what's going on dad
mr marsh you have to move it isn't
oh god  i'm  i'm so  startled  arrrgh
my name is craig tucker last week was my birthday  my grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars  i was sooo happy but then four kids from school came to my house  and said i should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a peruvian flute band  they promised i would double my money in one afternoon  but the government arrested us along with all the other peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in miami  we begged to go home but instead the government told us they were sending us to peru  and so that is now why i'm in peru if i die let it be known that it is because four guys i don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money
we didn't lie craig it was a sweet idea
yeah how are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed
i don't get it they said the military would meet us here
this is where they told us to land can you get through to washington
i'm trying
this is connor in washington
hey connor the place that homeland security told us to start the operation there there's nobody here to meet us it's like they sent us to no man's land
jesus they're everywhere
what are everywhere
so furry they're attacking every city ha people dying ha guinea pigs all over agh
guinea pigs
can't stop them need to get out ergh i just ate a peanut agh peanut now stuck in throat urgh shouldn't eat peanut when scared
i've got the video camera got it turned on again  okay this is randy marsh i'm shooting this video of myself twenty minutes ago some huge creatures attacked our town still chaos out the window  i barely made it back to the house sharon is here with me  and there's shelly  wave to the camera shelly
randy will you put down that camera we need to figure out what to do
i don't know what to do i'm so startled
we have to see what the news is saying
this is a shot of new york city where the giant guinea pigs have also attacked
guinea pigs
reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world
jesus this thing is worldwide
look at that thing randy what are we gonna do
oh my god oh my god oh my gohhhd
go randy run
gotta get out
michaels harrison anybody  nothing lsat is down and no answer at rcu whatever is going on out there is huge
ah all right just let me get this straight the head of homeland security ordered you to fly us five kids to peru but had you land way up in the andes mountains of peru so that other government people could meet us and then somehow tell us how to go to the capital of peru way over in lima and take down their government
yes that was the order
and that makes sense to you
nope not at all
actually the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either
none of what that homeland security guy does make sense so could you just fly us home please
you don't understand the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here we don't have enough gas to fly anyplace
oh that's awesome
so we've gotta find another way out of here
it's starting to look that way yeah
this is fun let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle it just keeps getting better and better
you know what we're getting pretty sick of your attitude craig
yeah
nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time
luck at that no lights on nothing it's like humans have never been to this part of peru
more guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions we checked on wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the andes mountains here
what about the pan flute bands are they on their way to guantanamo bay
sir we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands
have they been loaded onto the boats or not
no sir we diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs
that was an order  the pan flute bands were to be put on boats to guantanamo last night  i am still in charge here i want those pan flute bands on the boats to guantanamo
yes sir i don't see why you have to yell at people
hey we're down in main street now and  wah oh ohh look at that  ohhh
where do we go randy
we've got to get out of town go through that way
geow my arm my arm
oh jesus
randy run
okay we're running now  there's sharon and shelly running wave to the camera shelly
dad
in there in there  oh god oh god i'm so startled are you startled sharon
randy put down that c
it's gonna kill us
just stay down shelly it can't come in here
hold on hold on i need to get a shot of it from outside
randy where are you going
here we see a view from outside the bus
randy  what the hell are you doing
i got a really good shot of it sharon
i don't know lemsky this entire area of peru isn't even charted on the maps
this whole valley is strange just look at the size of that fruit  ain't that a peach and how do you like them apples
take a look at this they look like beehive combs
oh my god
dude what is this place
it's like an unknown valley that time forgot where everything grows huge
that's a shock i decided to follow you guys and now i'm in the land of the giants lost world
craig it isn't our fault you make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice
yeah stuff just happens
stuff just happens
that's right
you just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world
that's right
you know when stuff happens to most kids they fall off their bikes they get in fights with their parents they get swindled out of their birthday money
look wherever we are i think we'd better keep moving
hey look out
ohhh stop it make it stohhhp
all right all right here's sharon and shelly on the roof of best buy we we run up here to get off the streets we found the stotch family hiding up here also there's chris and linda and their son butters
hello heh
what is that chris what is that
that's a that's a that's a new sound
oh god look
those aren't guinea pigs
get off the roof

they're a peruvian band that escaped we must keep them contained
no no listen to me the peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands
i said shoot them
go look it's all an ancient incan prophecy
maybe we should look at it sir
damn you craiiig you just don't ever stop do you
i didn't say anything
you see for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the guinea valley of peru the incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay by playing pan flute music guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do but the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and i have made that happen the incas predicted the world would be saved by craig but that part of the prophecy will not come true for you will all die on this mountain
you're you're some kind of monster
oh i'm much more than that guinea bees guinea rabbits guineasaurus rexes i am something much more evil  arrrgh
guinea pirate
jesus christ
sir i promise you i'm not going to ruin your plans i'll just walk away see
dargh no
okay now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes
argh curse ye craig dar argh
my name is craig tucker last week i stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth all the peruvian flute bands were released  and drove the guinea creatures back to the andes mountains  many people had died but mankind had prevailed  all over the world survivors were found living witnesses to the horror that had been seen
here here look look  what the  oh ohhh i didn't have a tape in it
the guinea pirate lived but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days  and people all over the world learned to support their local peruvian flute bands and buy their cds for they protect us from the guinea creatures as for me i was returned home by homeland security  my parents were sooo happy  i realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us  we are but players on the stage of life and i also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money
that guy's an asshole
yeah what a dick
i fuckin' hate craig
sir sir we have a problem
what now
the former director of homeland security that turned out to be a guinea pig it attacked the guards got out of its holding cell
my god are you telling me
yes sir it broke out of prison

it's mccain we did it obama is president
yeah so i've heard you guys are out of your freakin' minds you know that
yes we do assemble the rest of the team we've only got ten hours
sure hard part's over right
actually the hard part's just starting
yoohoo
obama yeah i can't believe it
o ba ma o ba ma
o ba ma o ba ma
cehhhlebrate good obama come on  it's obamobama
yes i'd like to make a noise complaint

what are you a mccain voter
yeah
sorry pal but obama's president now  obama obama
obama obama
yeah yeah flip the flip the cop car flip the cop car
ey put down my car
yes we can
no no hey stop it
jesus christ
obama you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind hey obama hey obama
hey you guys wanna buy a tv
bravo obama and mccain ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off
guys we've all known each other a long time had many incredible adventures but this is going to be our greatest feat ever
i knew it i knew when you two ran for president you were just working an angle
always workin' the angles
my friends while the entire country is busy reacting to the election we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history
so come on enlighten us what are we stealing this time
the hope diamond rated  of the ten most precious diamonds in the world going street value middleeastern market of course two hundred and ten million dollars
two hundred ten
million
no no no the hope diamond is ungettable every thief in the world knows that
almost ungettable the diamond is kept in the smithsonian natural history museum long considered to be the most thiefproof structure ever built  the diamond wing is protected by impenetrable walls of twofoot wide steel on the northeast side a sevenfive laser system  there's simply no side of the smithsonian that can be breached
so you go in from the roof drop into it from the top
can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse
okay you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above so you can't get the diamond
meet the presidential escape tunnel  a twomile long underground passage that runs from the white house to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack the tunnel is only accessible from the oval office and just happens to travel right underneath the smithsonian natural history museum
boom baby
you get somebody into that tunnel they can blast into the museum let the others in the heist is on
so you both run for president because one of you has to win and you've got your access to the tunnel
and we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next eight hours
this all sounds very risky
we've spent ten years putting this plan together if we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world
and we are
we won't get caught
yes ah i'm trying to locate my parents mmy name is kyle broflovski yes i know obama won
kyle kyle you gotta get out here
what
your little brother has climbed out of the window i i think he's gonna jump
oh my god
ike don't do it there's still so much to live for  i know you really wanted mccain to win but but it's going to be okay  no that's not true ike the economy could easily stabilize with obama's plan  ike don't jump you could really hurt your ankle or something  really ike that's like five feet off the ground don't do it
goodbye
noo
ike  oh crap ike
all right everyone i'm turning in for the night go to standard security team

i hope to god you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the l charges
i'm in the tunnel now sarah i should be almost below the museum

oh my god you've got the wrong flippin' people
we aren't vampires
i know that you aren't really vampires and i appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the in thing right now but
we aren't trying to be popular
but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction
here's a couple more principal victoria hm'kay
oh oh no are we in trouble
i was just telling your friends about what i expect of your
we aren't friends
don't worry ma'am as i was just explaining to my new minions vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings per se
allison merch is a vampire kid now this thing isn't going to stop
let's just face it they bogarted our style everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now we might as well go to the freakin' gap and just buy normal clothes
well at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now
it went this way
yeah it's over there by that fat girl the bignosed kid the midget and the kid with pock marks on his face
so we're back to that are we
shit
let's get out of these freakin' gap clothes
sorry eric but i am a vampire now and i can no longer survive on human food and if someone must die so that i can feed i choose thee  hm wonder which side i'm supposed to do it on hm probably doesn't matter
butters  butters
i can't do it ah i i can't do it
dude gross you got spit all over my neck mom butters just gave me a hickey
i'm so hungry but just just remembering how that blood tasted before ju blood is all clammy and tomatoy it makes me wanna
dude
you all right sweetie
uhuh  ow
what's going on
well mom apparently butters is gay finds me very attractive and confused about his sexual identity puked up all over my floor
oh dear
yes
i walked into the cafeteria today rebecca miller and philip russ were dressed like vampires drinking clamato juice with four kids from the football team
jesus
it's like there's more vampire kids every freakin' day why is this happening i mean why now
doesn't matter why pretty soon the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happygolucky vampire wannabes
it seems like that preppy mike makowski kid started all this maybe he's the way to stopping it
whattaya mean
i mean what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal you get rid of the head vampire
does your mom know you took her car
do i care
all right this is probably good enough
yeah pull over here
please what do you want let me go
what should we do with him
well if he's a vampire i guess we should drive a stake through his heart
no i'm not really a vampire i'm not a vam i'm not a vampire
what's that
i'm not really a vampire
you're not really a vampire really i'm so freaking shocked
if we get the right packaging we can just fedex him somewhere far way
how about we send him to transylvania
no he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies
if we're gonna send him somewhere it should be the most horrible most miserable place on earth
scottsdale
butters we just got a call from mrs cartman butters  unbelievable he's locked the door
butters this is your father explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey  butters butters you will open this door right now

stephen what has happened to our boy
he's become something linda something that we cannot ground
i just don't get it we sent the head vampire kid to scottsdale but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires
he must not have been what was causing it it must be something else
hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again
leave us alone
bad enough i always get stuck with you goth kids now i got goth kids in my entire section
they aren't goth they're douchey little vampire kids
looks the same to me
i bet they aren't even drinking coffee

let's go over there and tell them they're not taking village in from us too
forget it it's over all right there's too many of them now we can't stop them let's just face it the freakin' vampires beat us
maybe not  did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires  i want to help you
get away douchebag
some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair the vampires go back to being human again
what are you talking about
i can take you to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires
awww hot topic when did this open
two weeks ago it used to be a banaaana repuuubliiic
of course freaking hot topic that explains everything
how did we not figure that out of course a new hot topic must have come to town duh
well i think we all know what has to be done
yup
let's get to it
burn down down burn down hot topicdon't let it steal your soul awayburn down burn down hot topiclight the fire take controlburn down burn down hot topicdon't let it take your soulburn down burn down burn down hot topicand take controlburn down hot topicburn it down hot topic
hey what the hell are you doing

what's that dad
well would you mind telling me why there's ricearoni in my coffee
uh oh
butters you are grounded
ahh dangit
it worked linda our son is groundable once more
fellow students over the past week there's been a lot of confusion and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between goth kids and vampire kids let us make it abundantly clear if you hate life truly hate the sun and need to smoke and drink coffee you are goth if however you like dressing in black 'cause it's fun enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded
fuck all of you
line

take off the ring you can take off the ring  really
let's take them off and just be kids again there'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late s and we're boring and lame anyway
yeah screw this crap
oh i feel better already
me too
what say you and me go to tgi fridays
woohoo
and so as we commit this young child to the earth let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease and it can be caught even if using protection this young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee for the world of oral sex is a world
i told him a woman's mouth is the most germridden place on earth i said statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis i said
well now we know
and knowing is half the battle
the city isn't what it used to be it all happened so fast everything went to crap it's like everyone's sense of morals just disappeared bad economy made things worse  the jobs started drying up then the stores had to shut down  then a black man was elected president he was supposed to change things  he didn't  as more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear dark times the city needs protection  there is an animal that lives by night searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage  to clean out the trashcan of society i've chosen to become more than a man  i'm the hero this town needs i am  the coon  as the world plummets into despair the coon fights to keep order intact
lisa i had a really great time tonight
i did too josh
would you mind very much if kissed you
not at all
a woman being raped this is what our city has been reduced to when the money goes the raping starts women are helpless without the coon
ohoh yes josh yehehessss
let her go
'scuse me
you aren't raping anyone tonight
oh it's a talking squirrel  oh
ah
oh ow wugh oh
get out of here get to safety
ugh llisa call me oh ow
another woman saved from rape but how many more rapists are out there
oh that really stings
here's that file on the rodriguez case detective
alright things are pretty quiet out there boys let's try to get caught up on some paperwork murphy i want you to
don't let the city's peacefulness fool you commissioner it's too quiet
oh not this kid again
hey you get out of here out
there was another rapist in the park tonight  it's no coincidence it must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top
what
i think the mayor might be involved it's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash
jesus christ  can we get a lock on that window  look kid you need to stop
he's gone
no i'm just over here now  what do we know about the mayor's sexual preferences
alright listen you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents
jail's full sir
whatever then we'll just put you in
now i'm back over here
just get out of here before we
i'm right here now
all right stop it
yes i have to go now  but in the meantime i have something that might interest you  make sure all your men get a look at these detective
what's in here
hey guys good morning  you guys hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night they say it was the coon
who's the coon
i know right  who is the coon it's what everyone must be asking themselves somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands as for me i certainly don't agree with the coon's reckless ways if you ask me there's no room in this world for vigilantes i believe the coon is a menace
yeah and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway
you're a fag kyle fuck you
dude what
he's not a fag
why do you care
oh i uh well i ah ah  i'm just i'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term fag kyle that's a hate word and it's insensitive to butt pirates anyway what do you think about the coon stan and kenny do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante  kenny
and of course the most common question asked is just who is he  is he a hero or a menace  while we can all admit that the coon is obviously really cool we should also be asking each other why does he care so much for the people of this town why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime and does he really have the right what we all need now  clyde clyde could you wake up please this is important  what we all need now is proof that the coon exists i believe that tonight from approximately  to  the coon is going to be on the roof of walgreens i know i'll be there with my camera and i'm sure many of you will too
sometimes it seems the more criminals i try to stop the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars the city is a dying whore she calls out to me to save her and i don't know if i can but she is still my city  and i cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are  who the hell is that  who the hell are you
i'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night as violence and darkness take over the streets i work to rid this city of crime i'm the symbol this town needs
aw nonononono i am the symbol this town needs  dude seriously you can't do that go home i was i was doing this first
nuh uh
yeah huh you heard of the coon and now you're being a copycat is that your name copycat
i am mysterion
mysterion that's fucking retarded you just gave yourself away craig only you would think of a name that dumb
i might be craig and then again i might not be my identity must remain a secret you cannot know
yeah well you cannot know my true identity either
i assume you must be cartman because you're fat
well you're wrong i'm not eric cartman and he's not fat care to guess again
i really don't care who you are
oh all right kyle yeah took me real long to figure it out only you kyle would be a buzzkill and try to steal my thunder you don't care about stopping crime you're just doing this 'cause you hate me kyle
kyle hates eric cartman are you saying you're eric cartman
no i'm no i  i'm sayin' that goddammit stan is that you it is you isn't it clyde clyde you're not a superhero i am
i cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer the city needs my help there are innocents to protect
no dude i'm seriously you're being a copycat i'll sue you  motherfucker
which one of them is it somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero but who has to be one of the guys in my class 'cause only they knew that the coon would be on the rooftop of walgreens  no stop can't think about that right now have to focus  tomorrow is the most important day in the coon's life everything the coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow concentrate
how is it that nobody came to coonicon  this is just this is fucking ridiculous
got everything you need here sir okay on beverages buffet items
yes it's fine
great hey i just want to say that the airport hilton really appreciates your continued business
what do you mean continued you don't know who i am
aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his aids benefit here before

why is cartman crossed out he he could be mysterion
no he's too fat based on his body type it's gotta be someone like stan or kyle
alright al alright alright look chaos just set up a video camera i know how we can put an end to mysterion once and for all
the clock is ticking and the citizens of south park are gripped in fear two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if mysterion  does not reveal his identity

citizens tonight has shown me i have no choice but to unmask myself
don't do it mysterion if you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante
don't you think he knows that but superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good
don't show your face mysterion
you have to be a symbol
so that the next terrorist can threaten south park if he doesn't unmask himself
no it's true as long as my identity is a mystery this will just happen again and again it has to end i will show my face

this is a  news special report recession a nation in peril
an economic crisis has hit south park and the nation like never before another south park bank has closed down leaving thousands of people in debt
it's just crazy you know eveveryone's affected by it it's like all the money just vanished
it's really terrifying we we've got no money to pay our mortgage now we could very easily lose our house
hi grandma
first the money started goin' and now everyone's gettin' laid off work they took arrr jawbs
they took our jobs
trk rrr jrrbs
tuck rjrrbs
turk rjrrrbs
just how far will the economy fall we asked economic reporter dan banks for his assessment  we'll have the rest of dan's interview tonight at
all right everyone eat up
aw jesus christ sliced hot dogs and tomato slices
you said we had to be very careful with our money i've got nothing for our food budget
mom dad how come there's suddenly no money
i'll tell you what happened son see there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had  they wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need  people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying  and these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing  'cause they thought money was endless  it goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in america deserves to own a house so we have people having a hard time paying their loans  meaning less money coming in  and the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the economy and they made the economy very angry  we're all feeling the economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money do you understand son
yeah i think i get it
and so why is our economy failing us because the government kept interest rates too low for too long the government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price how long will we sit and watch our economy just as the people we must
an angel came to me and so i say to you do not listen to the wall street brokers for they are the ones that put us in this situation fat cats with corporate greed they are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom our responsibility is
and where has all the money gone it must have gone somewhere the answer is obvious my friends it is the jews covetous jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves hidden all the cash in some secret jew cave that they built probably back in the early s it is the jews my friends who are oft
there are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person but the fault lies in all of you  you who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down you who bought that third car even though only two people in your home drive it is time to stop pointing fingers  finger pointing gets us nowhere steve we have mocked our economy and now the economy has cast its vengeance upon us all
he's right
this is the first guy to actually make sense
yea it is an angry and unforgiving economy to repent we must stop frivolous spending instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds instead of buying clothes wear but sheets from thine beds cut spending to only the bare essentials water and bread and margaritas yea
hello young man welcome to sur la tahbluh can i help you
yeah i wanna return this margaritaville my stupid dad bought
oh that's all we get anymore returns could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh  sorry our computers are a little slow today we need a new ethernet cahbluh oh i'm sorry sir i'd like to give you a refund but i'm afraid it's not doahbluh
what
i said i'm not ahbluh sir you see this margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan
so
well an outside financing company handles those payment plans customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest
well can't i just return it and get the money my dad put in back
hm that's improbahbluh  but not impossibluh i'm not really sure how it works you'll you'll have to speak with the people at the top i can give you the finance company's address if that agreeahbluh with you
we have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the economy there are those who will say that the economy has forsaken us nay you have forsaken the economy and now you know the economy's wrath o thoust can shop at a sporting goods store but knowest thou that the economy will take away thy broncos' cap from thine head  mock the economy without fear thine own stockbrokers now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the economy well here we are my friends you have brought the economy's vengeance upon yourselves
what can we do randy
yes tell us
tell us
tell us what to do
tell us randy what we should do
what should we do randy
we must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent instead of cars that take gasoline we can get around on llamas from drake's farm instead of video games that take batteries and software our kids will play with squirrels we must let the economy know that we are capable of respecting it no more needless spending  the economy is our shepherd we shall not want
mornin' ted
mornin' al
well this sucks
sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff
hengh  of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things it had to be the week that grand theft auto  comes out for nintendo ds  hengh
you want something new every week fatass
don't you fraternize me this is all your fault you know
my fault
the jews took all the money away and they ha
don't even start don't even start cartman
well  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels kyle
not because of the jews butters who told you that
well eric did
just tell us where the cave is kyle
now look the reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid the economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us the economy is just made up of people and people have just lost their faith in it  what people really should be doing is spending more spending is fine people should just go outside people should just go outside they should buy the things they need for their friends and family
we best speak with the council and tell them a young jew is speaking heresy towards the economy
can i help you
i wanna return this margaritaville
okay let me send you into josh
heeey welcome to big orange finance company yeah have a seat you want some carmex
no thanks i wanna return this margaritaville and the guy at sur la table said that you were the company that financed it
oh yeah no you know what no yeah
what
yeah we can't give you your money back for that yeah no you'd have to talk to the people on wall street yeah mmmm
wall street
yeah no see what i do is find americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one and i hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business yeah
so
yeah so the problem is your margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big margaritaville security yeah no yeah no yeah
the entire town has given over to your ways mr chairman everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills
you've really done an amazing thing mr marsh people have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the economy's mighty sword
i am pretty smart yea but i have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan
we've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff and uh pat sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online
then perhaps soon our economy will return to us
council i bring news of discord a young jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the economy
what
he was saying that your ideas are false and the economy is not vengeful he was rallying people to spend more
spend more what mockery is this
relax father maxi what harm can one jew do against our economic recovery movement
i had a dream last night i was in a field and i had grand theft auto chinatown wars right next to me but then the sky went black and grand theft auto chinatown wars just melted in my hand
what's that
'scuse me we need to borrow your squirrels
what
now please please
you have sinned
oh jesus i'm sorry please
what's going on
garrison you have brought your filth to this town for the last time
what did he do
your teacher was caught buying a kitchenaid stand mixer at bed bath  beyond
take that punishment heathen
hey hey stop it stop
move aside kid he must pay for his stand mixer
come on this is ridiculous
what's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the economy
jujust have a little compassion huh i mean everyone's gone out and bought something stupid it's not so bad whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous go ahead and huck the next squirrel
oh
'scuse me 'scuse me i'd like to return this margaritaville please
margaritaville
my dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here
oh that makes sense
it does
you see son we lump thousands of these margaritaville installment plans together into margaritavillebased securities then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks
so i can return it to a bank
nope because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their margaritavilles so the government had to buy the margaritavilles assets from the banks
what
just talk to the treasury department in dc they're the ones who really understand how all this works  oh sell sell sell sell sell sell sell
aargh
listen this is all you need to know the economy is not a supernatural allknowing entity the economy is just an idea made up by people thousands of years ago the economy is not real and yet it is real nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them  i applied for this yesterday to prove a point it is an american express platinum card  it has no spending limit  do not be afraid this is only plastic it's just something made up by people truly meaningless until we put our faith in it faith is what makes an economy exist without faith it is only plastic cards and paper money
by all reports the young jew is not letting up he is still going around convincing people to have faith in the economy by shopping
we've done everything we can and yet the economy has not improved worse it has declined poor bart here just lost his job at little caesar's pizza our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one jew why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the economy
perhaps he is the economy's only son sent to save us
are you retarded stotch the economy is omnipotent which means it can do anything so saying it would be limited to one son is fucking stupid
that is stupid yea and going around telling people to shop is dangerous
well then there's only one option we have to kill the jew
yep i think we gotta kill the jew
i don't know he's got a lot of support it might be hard to even catch this jew
did somebody say catch a jew the person you're after might be hard to get but i can bring him to you and all i want in return is grand theft auto chinatown wars for handheld nintendo ds
uhh how can we help you young man
i want to return this margaritaville my dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from wall street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you
ohhh that makes sense
nnnaaargh
no problem we just need to consult the chart we can determine your property's value and we'll be done
really  thank you
be right back
excellent news sir we've determined the investment value of your margaritaville to be ninety trillion dollars
what
hey what's the matter kyle you seem bbbubbbummed out
i just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this
well don't worry kyle we're not gonna let people kill you we'll keep you hidden forever
i can't just hide my whole life butters and besides i have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me
all right whoever is thinkin' of betraying kyle that is not cool  that's freaking lame dude kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again if somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back you're byou're being a dick  go ahead kyle
whoever it might happen to be i'm not giving him the opportunity tomorrow i'm going to do something something i've known i would have to do restore people's faith
kyle please for fufu for forfufuck's sake don't do anything drastic
there's no choice anymore guys don't worry about me i've been preparing for this for a while now
nononono excuse me i don't understand how can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars
what you think it's worth more
no dude that doesn't make sense
well you don't get ninety trillion dollars but the chart says that's what it's worth
uh oh problem problem again
what is it now
another insurance company is about to go under if they do people could lose millions
okay no problem  we'd better consult the chart
sirs another insurance company is going under
now determining most prudent move for insurance company
bailout
most prudent move is a bailout
bail out the insurance company
it's a miracle
why would someone do this
what is this what's going on
there look  it's the jew somehow he got a platinum amex with no spending limit
what's he doing
he's paying for everyone's debts
hey thanks kid this is really nice of you
but that's impossible why would he do this
so that people will have money to spend
kyle  kyle you have to stop this
it's okay ma
noo kyle you'll be in debt for the rest of your life  please somebody get him to stooop
uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here
heunh
he paid for our debts so we could spend once more
he's dead
no he's just passed out we should get him to bed
for the first time in almost a year the economy in south park has taken a small but noticeable upturn  stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debtfree people feel safe to make purchases
wow the new margaritaville  with salsa dispenser just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom oh we need this
are we out of the woods yet only time will tell but we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again the person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice  barack obama

they uh they aren't gonna show part  of the terrance and phillip show
doctor my sister is just being difficult maybe you can just examine my cervix instead
well alright let me check for cysts  nooo  that does it queef sisters i'm not your vaginal doctor anymore
oh katie i do believe we made the doctor angry
i guess so katherine
dude what the hell is this disgusting crap
what the hell is this disgusting crap
queef sisters
that's right it's a hot new canadian show we're trying out
you replaced our show with this but they aren't funny all they do is queef all the time
that's sick
you think farts are funny why not queefs
because babies come from there
eh look guys women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience you know women empowerment and the getgo so we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility sorry guys but if you ask me your farts have gotten stale
no no as a matter of fact i will not hold i've been on hold for thirtyfive minutes well we want some goddamned answers that's what we want like why did you show that smut instead of the terrance and phillip conclusion you asshole
what's going on
we're complaining to the canada network 'cause they put something really gross on tv
you wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face no no see some of us were eating when you showed that
i threw up on my way home
clyde threw up on his way home what makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television
you tell 'em cartman
what happened
they didn't show part  of terrance and phillip  they replaced it with the queef sisters
it was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people
oh what so farts are hysterical but queefs are gross
you know that little kids could have been watching that what kind of network are you running there in canada don't call me buddy i'm not your buddy
i can't believe they're this upset
god they're annoying
i don't even know what a queef is
it's when a woman blows air out her vag annie
oh
you know that girl samantha dunskin she can make herself queef whenever she wants
really
wait a minute i've got an idea
and to that end by resorting to filth and garbage the canada channel has thusly
robbed us of our innocence
yes that's good
robbed us of our innocence
hey guys we have a little surprise for you
what
oh god oh my god no
butters
oh my god well how is he doing yeah yeah i'm sure huh okay well thank you for telling me mr stotch i'll spread the word yoeah you take care bye  we need to cancel our plans sharon there's gonna be an emergency allparent meeting at the school tonight
why what happened
a girl at school she queefed on one of stan's friends today
so
hey pal i heard about what happened at school today you wanna talk about it
butters was just sitting there dad he he didn't even know it was coming
i know pal sometimes bad things happen to good people but you know butters is still butters and he needs you guys right now more than anybody
it was so gross dad i mean what if another girl at school tries
hey we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this okay nothing like this will ever happen again
m'kay parents some of you have already heard but most of you have not m'kay we've had a terrible incident occur at the school apparently a young girl uh went up to a young boy here at the school m'kay and queefed in his face
how did this happen
where were the teachers
whoa whoa whoa wait a minute are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy
just
we're here to find out why
the question is how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again
now hold on a minute i think we're being a little drastic here you know i probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl
what does that have to do with anything
our next guests have really taken america by storm their hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world please welcome the queef sisters
oh hello regis
hello kelly
so uh gals you seem to really like queefing
well reeg it's like this we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function why not have fun with it
but i mean really isn't queefing a bit juvenile
men enjoy farts so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs
that's right we've written all about it in our new feminist book eat pray queef
well i think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing and that's why women all over america stand behind you
d'ohhh
terrance and phillip you've put on a terrific show for many many years you've made canada channel what it is today you're fired
fired
sorry guys but this queefing thing is really catching on  queef sisters' ratings are through the roof and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you goodbye here's some cookies
brian don't do this
you can't let canada channel be soiled by that perverse garbage you know it's sick
yes i know it's sick to be honest i gag every time one of them lets out a queef  but it's money goddammit and this channel needs it i'm sorry terrance  phillip your show is done
i always love when spring is on the way such a fun and inspiring time to decorate just like most women out there i've really gotten into queefing lately  it's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays what we're gonna do is just cut out some paper like this  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes  and we're gonna just jam those up and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores they come in little tube which make them very easy to just  shoot right up the ol' there we are and of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive easter grass but the point is that when we're done we can let one rip  see how pretty that was it's a good thing
what was that
oh excuse me i  i i had a little air trapped
oh my god did you just at the table
pardon me
mom gross
okay that's enough girls alright i mean how old are you sharon
sorry it's just it's kind of funny how much it bothers you
oh yeah yeah that's really funny
stop it mom
yeah okay let's just try to have a nice dinner okay
okay okay i'm sorry i'm sorry
sharon marsh
excuse me
hey mom do you like australia 'cause that was the great barrier queef
that's it i'm leaving
i'm going too
oh oh please randy how many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers
that's completely different
yeah it's different mom
alright tell me exactly where the line is er okay how about this i have a friend abbie she had a baby boy and it farted
heh yeah
but she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her
yeah
and then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina haha
come on stanley let's go
oh oh so when does that stop being funny
it stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina sharon
look katherine i made queef cookies

oh my god look katherine it's canadian television stars terrance  phillip
oh my god they're famous  well hello sirs it is such an honor to meet you oh katie i'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy
wooo
may we come in please
oh certainly though i feel we look a mess
very nice place you have here network must be paying you well
oho yes the show is going aboat as well as it could
all right enough with the queefing we didn't come for a social call
that's right we've come to kill you
why kill us we love you
because you've reduced canada channel to smut and toilet humor
oh well i suppose if we're going to die we should die by the hands of our idols
your idols
we grew up watching you you meant the world to us we used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways know that it is an honor to die by your hand
i don't think i can do it phillip
why not
because i'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to katherine
what that's crazy terrance katie is obviously the hot one
ohhhhh ohhhhh
hey butters how you holding up man
oh hey fellas
we got you a present butters i'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on
aw thanks
butters i'm afraid things have gotten worse all the women suddenly think that queefing is funny
ohhhhh ohhhhh
calm down butters the men are taking action but we need to take your picture
my my picture
you're going to be the face of queef abuse butters so that we can make people open their eyes
aah
dammit i'm trying to enjoy my wine katie
no that was me phillip i farted
oh
oh this is a dream come true i've always wanted to meet you phillip
phillip i'm terrance
what i thought you were terrance

oh dear
a disgusting violating trend is taking over our city our state our nation queefing has become an acceptable evil
last week at our school a girl queefed right into our friend's face that is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke
on television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing
i would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts we have the squeaker  and then there's the foghorn  and the don't be scared  and of course there's the
excuse me  well if that really is your argument it isn't a very sound one women name their queefs too
that's right we do
for instance we have the sneezing unicorn  and the resuscitator
sick stop it lady
ththat's not the same we've got the chinese firecracker
that's all well and good but we can do the road warrior
nooo we go iiin we kiiill no more talk we kiiill soon my dog of war but we have to do it my way  losers losers wait
awww
jesus christ
you stupid bitch what the fuck is wrong with you
i'm not your sex toy you fucking pig
ugh you don't queef in bed while we're having sex
fuck you you don't fucking slap me
could you please keep it down we're trying to have sex over here
she queefed while we were having sex terrance
sick
well what's the big deal i've been queefing in this bed the entire time
what gross
how dare you
get out get out both of you  we never want to see you again
after everything we've been through
what the hell am i going to do phillip she makes me so mad sometimes
katherine just won't stop queefing but i don't know if i can live without her
katie i'm sorry i was wrong
me too katherine i don't love your queefs but dammit i love you
oh terrance
phillip
oh my god  ohmygod stan  stan we did it colorado senate moves to ban queefing
no way we did it  yeah
alright son yeah
what's going on
ha read it and weep sharon no more queefing
well congratulations guys looks like you got us good job
aw come on  just because you can't queef anymore
you really think women cared that much about queefing is that really what you think this has all been about this has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense for just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable but no you just couldn't let us have that one little thing could you because even though things are getting better for women you still think of us as lesser people sometimes and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard congratulations guys  for getting your way again
mom we didn't mean
boy oh boy i think we might have screwed up royal stan
yeah we all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize women actually cared about something a lot deeper
stan let's call the guys together maybe we can make this right
there's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed
and realize we've been keeping women down
they have power and they have courage
and we must all stand by the belief
that a woman is strong and she has the right to queef
fly free free to queef aloud fly free let every queef show that youre proud
you face so many challenges to put an end to your grief
you are woman now and you are free to queef
it's time for equality we must give them the respect they deserve
they're just the same as you and me their rights must be preserrrrrrrrrved
queef free queef free every woman has the right queef free queef free let your queefing stars shine brightyou are woman hear you roar queef free queefing too loud to ignore queef a little each day and let your soul take flightahaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah queef free
for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh  nooo
stop it katherine this is a serious moment
therefore what god has joined together let no man
aww sick
that's it i now pronounce you farts and queefs

it is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived and its origin is unknown the fishsticks joke crosses all border all races all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country in fact the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper kanye west who becomes furious when people use the joke on him
yo that is messed up yo i am not gay and i sure as hell ain't no fish alright
you really don't get it
hey man i'm a genius alright i'm the most talented musician in the world if i was a homosexual or a fish i would know

and then it was on leno and the jimmy kimmel show dude that's our joke on national television
we know cartman
nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya we are comedy writers and you guys aren't ha ha ha ha haaa ha jimmy i've been thinking we've got to patent the fishsticks joke
ppatent
yeah dude there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows we should be getting compensated
well eric ththat's really not how jokes work i mean you know we should just be happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh
dude fuck that maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement but i don't work for free i'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us
jimmy exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did cartman write
well he didn't actually write any of it he just uh
let me guess you wrote the joke and cartman just laid on the couch eating twizzlers
actually it was potato chips
i knew it don't let that fat turd walk all over you jimmy stand up for yourself
wwell ii mean he he was in the room
then just give him half
what
i like you jimmy but you're not gonna win this consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half
craig if cartman didn't do anything then he doesn't deserve any of the credit
yep and if i had wheels i'd be a wagon
no dude screw that jimmy if cartman didn't write the joke then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him just say cartman you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it
just give him half
there are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue but i'm going to prove once and for all i'm not a fish because i am a genius i've ascertained that fish have gills  doctor do i have gills
he does not have gills
you hear that no gills so i can't be a fish and i'm a genius voice of a generation so i'm not gay so that is that alright it's over now are there any questions
do you like fishsticks
love 'em
you're a gay fish
no i'm not aaaargh
alright recently recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest most awesome joke ever but who originally came up with it well here's your answer joining us tonight the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke the one and only carlos mencia
yeheah vive la mexico
so carlos you've got a show on comedy central a standup tour where did you have time to come up with this classic joke
well you know i just kicking it with my homies and my brain you know my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause i'm so fonny and stuff so i was just all like hey papito you like fishsticks and my homeboy says yeah carlos you know you're so funny and then it just occurred to me i said oh man you must be a gay fish homes  and this is how i came up with it my amigos
motherfucker
jimmy dude did you see carlos mencia is taking credit for our joke
really
yeah dude i told you this would happen now look i got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers we've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me
aahhm i don't know eric i really don't think i want to sign that very much
but jimmy some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do
well to be perfectly ffffrank eric i think i came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did
what
well you know i mean i basically wrote the thing and you just kind of ate chips
jimmy that's messed up we decided that day to write together don't you remember
hey jimmy wanna hang out
sorry eric but i've gotta write some jokes unless you wanna team up or somethin'
team up okay let's write some jokes together
here's some fishsticks guys i hope you like fishsticks

what do you mean i don't get it house i'm a genius i'll understand it i just need to break it down is all now let's see  somethin' about fishsticks interacting with me makes me gay fish
kanye really
shut up  alright now what do we know about fishsticks  they're breaded they're fried they're frozen then under me we have rapper genius and gay fish are homosexual they swim  is it because breaded has something to do with genius which swims

i don't need anyone tellin' me play on words i'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius
hey kyle can i talk to you for a second

it's just i don't know what to do about jimmy i'm starting to think he might try and jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke  i just need you to teach me some jew defensive moves kyle because we really both did come up with it
you know what cartman i believe you
you do
yes i believe that you believe you helped write that joke that's how people like you work your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself and people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome when really they're just douchebags
but i'm sure i helped come up with the joke didn't i
hey jimmy what's up dawg
oh hey eric just workin' on some jokes
that's cool you wanna write some together

thank you thank you very much well about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke and ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it  but today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke please welcome the comedy team of cartman and valmer  hey guys
hi ellen  do you guys like fishsticks  thank you thank you no really thank you
so guys i gotta ask how did you come up with this incredible joke
it was just a
ellen comedy is like a game of racquetball you know you serve and the other person hits it back it bounces off the wall you backhand it and it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke thank you
but guys this joke is so perfect can you explain how nobody thought of it before
well ellen the tr tr tr
truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before i mean let's be perfectly honest a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled but i see past that i look beyond jimmy's disabilities and find a bond which can unite us in comedy working with crippled people is really important
that's so great and and are you crying jimmy
yes ma'am
ahaw don't cry pal you're gonna get me started anyway what was really important for us as a team ellen was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke and not carlos butthole mencia
i see and did you know that carlos mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole
uhhh excuse me
get my jet ready looks like we got another inning to play
alright so check it out we've got offers from van de kamp's and gorton's fisherman to do commercials
it's always been my dream to go on a national tv show and talk about the cccraft of comedy
yeah that was kewl huh
eric there's something i really need to know
whassat
how do you live with yourself you know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke  but you just keep pretending how do you look at yourself in the fffucking mirror that's what i want to know
so here it is
how do you take credit for something you didn't do
that is bullcrap jimmy and you know it i had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did  dude it's puff daddy
tie up these motherfuckers  now i'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time why did you start these rumors about me
please i wasn't starting rumors about you i don't even know who you are
aw right everyone knows who i am i wanna know how this got started
well we we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then
oh so now it's we huh jimmy a minute ago you said you did it all yourself
well i just but i buh i was gonna ebeh
abebeh abebebebebeah we both came up with it together you wanna know how it happened
hello jim
oh boy it's my best pal eric
what are you up to
i'm trying to write jokes but i'm not as funny as you so it's tough
well maybe i can help you we can team up
ruh really wow you would help me even though i'm crippled you are caring and not fat
now let's see how about a joke that has something to do with fishsticks you know 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks jimmy
eric cartman you are handsome and not even remotely fat
thanks  so what i'm thinking is do you like fishsticks in your mouth
what was that
eric eric you have to save us an entire army of jew robots
oh my god what are jewbots doing here  flame on  flame off
you saved everyone from the jewbots cartman
come on jimmy we gotta go back and finish that joke  like fishsticks in your mouth what are you a gay fish there
wow eric incredible too bad i'm a dick and i'm gonna take all the credit sususuck it bitch
aw dammit i guess it really was all me who came up with it
what
you've gotta let jimmy go it's all my fault
jesus eric he's gonna kill you you won't even admit it was just me knowing you're gonna die
jimmy you really believe that you came up with it all on your own oh my god wait i totally get it now
what i i still don't get anything
all this time i've been mad at you jimmy for trying to take all the credit but now i realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently that's what kyle was trying to tell me that you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things
rih rrreally
i thought you were just trying to jew me out of my part of the credit but now i realize that some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them they can't accept the truth of who they are  jimmy i owe you an apology i realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke because your ego won't let you think otherwise i just have to accept that
thanks eric for being so understanding
he's right for so long i've considered myself god's gift to the world that i couldn't take it when people made fun of me but they weren't makin' fun of me they were tryin' to help me  boys i understand what you did now  untie them guys i know what i have to do
yo kanye you sure about this
it's time for me to stop runnin' i need to believe what people tell me  let all my fans know i love 'em but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever don't be sad for me guys  i'm goin' home

sorry nobody in the world has seen anything uh what did this criminal alien do exactly
he stole over  parsohns of space cash from the universal bank you're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here
no we're sure
so then we're the first aliens you've ever seen
that's right yep you're the first ones
you don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life
uh that's r that's right  oh oh my god hey everybody we just made first contact
if you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you
we will give you a call
mathematical semitonal is fine
huh
something wrong sir
i don't know davert just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right
alright son now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before
i don't need it painted i just need it functional all right
hey the right paint job is a big part of what makes a pinewood derby car go fast
that's true
i swear if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for
dad it's over we have to tell everyone we cheated
no i've got it all figured out son you have to kill the alien
kill the alien
sshh i've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank i'm gonna call him over here to look at the car and when i do you shove that in his neck
no dad we don't even know what'll happen
what are you two whispering about riiight
oh no that's uh that's it we're done uh here come come take a look
dad
here see here look look real close at the axles here  yeahaah ahalright you got him son
alright men check the ship
you see stan what did daddy tell you everything worked out
i guess so it just still doesn't feel right
but stan it's over now we'll never have to lie again
hey marsh get in here
can you believe it
oh my god spaaace caaash
looks like those alien cops were right guess you should call them back now
right  but what if we didn't call the cops
huh
well i mean  this is a lot of space cash guys think o'what we could do with it
no dad
he's right we don't have to call the police back
all right let's get the cash put into boxes
whoawhoawhoa dad what are we doing
will you relax stan
don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself
that's right this is all of our planet the space cash belongs to all of us
either america shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops
alright fine look there's plenty of space cash to go around  thanks to us our planet is rich son
oh no china we get to keep the ship because we killed the alien you boner ohoh come on england you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else  oh crap it's the cops hang on  ah hey space officers
looks like the alien criminal did land here after all
oh that you were talking about that alien oh yeah that one he was here yeah he landed here but we we killed him
and so did you find the missing space cash
nnno space cash no  there wasn't any space cash
well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is
hey ah ah any of you other countries see any space cash
no space cash
no we haven't
no space cash
no
yeah it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here
uh huh guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet
probably
well you folks all take care now  just one more thing earthlings uh we had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries  mexico  has built  new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days
oh yeah mexico you know oh oh yeah all of us other countries chipped in and uh gave mexico some aid yeah they really needed some new water parks
uh huh have a good day
hey hey mexico we said no spending the space cash yet  what the hell are you doing will some country that speaks spanish yell at mexico please they're gonna ruin everything
no japan will you listen to me for five seconds if you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions
well then why can engrand build a nuclear power plant
nobody can build anything
yeah well it's not even gonna matter because finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth
wha finland
we believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did it's best we come clean now
will you just relax finland nobody is gonna find out anything
i'm sorry but our nation is resolved we cannot live with the guilt anymore
okay okay  you're right you're right finland okay you're right can you just let us other countries talk prprivate for a moment
very well
all right you guys we've gotta get rid of finland
yep we gotta take out finrand they gonna squeal
yeah i think we all agree guys
oh dammit
uh hey space officers how can we help you
well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries uh finland
whaawhawhat about it
it appears to have been destroyed
whaaat oh my god not finland
oh no not finland
hey guys finland's dead
oh no no nooo
noo not a finrand
all of finland gone
yeah somebody better break the news to norway they were really close
none of you knew anything about finland's destruction
no i mean odds are they nuked themselves you know suicide
we didn't say anything about nukes
or or whatever they did i'm sayin'
'scuse me 'scuse me  everyone i have an announcement to make i'm giving back my pinewood derby trophy
what
stan
the truth is i don't deserve this trophy 'cause i cheated on my pinewood derby car i used something not in the approved kit
not in the approved kit
he cheated on the pinewood derby
this trophy isn't mine and so i have to give it back because if i'm not honest now then i'll have to keep this lie going forever and it will just grow and grow
well stan we're proud of you for coming clean but it doesn't change the fact that you cheated go to your room son
your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words you sure you earthlings have nothing else to tell us
hey uh do we have anything else to tell the space cops
nope
nope
no changes
nope
no changes
nope
no tell them no
no changes
yeah no we've told you everything
all right that's it then come on out sir it appears to be over
aw shit it's baby fark mcgeezax
my real name is kevern zaksor i am the ambassador to new planet testing
what the hell are they talking about
these are not space cops  there is no space jail and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth i mean how stupid is your species space jail baby fark mcgeezax
it was a trick
whenever a civilization discovers warp speed we want to bring them into the federation of planets but first we do the space cash test to see if that species is worthy of joining
needless to say you all failed  people of earth since you did not return the space cash your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe goodbye

whoa whoa wait there really are ghosts
well of course there really are ghosts haven't you seen that show ghost hunters but i'm a pediatric doctor so i'm going to hand this off to dr phillips who specializes in spooky things
the ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest i've never sensed anything like it  i believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory
purgatory what's that
sometimes when people die they can't quite accept what has happened to them and so before they reach the afterlife they go to a place called purgatory it is a temporary plane of existence it's neither heaven nor hell purgatory is like being on an airplane that's waiting to take off but you're still sitting at the gate and even though the plane isn't taking off they won't let you back off the plane and you can't get up to go to the bathroom because you're on an active runway all these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on but for whatever reason they are stuck without any information even from the pilot how much longer it's going to be and it's taking forever and they aren't serving any drinks yet it's like a terrifying limbo
oh my god poor billy mays
i am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child if any spirit can hear my voice make your presence known
hi billy mays here with another fantastic product
billy mays  it's him
are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down

all you celebrities need to know that you have passed on
we know that
yeah of course we know that
there's only one person here who's not cooperating
that's right now just admit you're dead and sit down
no that's ignorant i'm not dead
uh oh

boys quickly convince michael jackson that he's dead

including the late and very talented billy mays

yo you can't just keep people stuck like this man
we know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane but for now you have to stay on this one
that's it i have to go to the bathroom
sir you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened
you've been saying that for three months now
alright let's see demonic ghosts animal ghosts  setting traps for ghosts no
okay here's the one part that really makes no sense to me  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear were you alarmed
was i alarmed  yes  i believe i was
so then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as chipotaway
chipotlaway kyle and i'm not the one who uses it my mom does she does the laundry
your mom uses chipotlaway to clean blood stains out of your underwear
yes
and then takes you to chipotle and buys you more
yes kyle it's totally normal  people do this stuff you know not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole
here here here it is possession by a ghost a ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be the ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be
what has michael jackson always tried to be
a child and a female and white
oh lookie it's a planet hee hee hee
so he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl
well what the hell are we gonna do dress him up in a princess gown and and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants

i'm a dork and i deserve what's coming to me  ow
alright your turn craig
fellas my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb
well that's what you get for being a douchebag again butters you gotta take your medicine
uyeah i guess i deserve it
hey heeey what the hell are you guys picking on butters for this time
aw dude you guys are not gonna believe this you know what we just found out well it turns out that butters our butters has never kissed a girl
uugh
so what
so what  so i'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork
that's right
you guys we got it  we got it sally darson is selling kisses for five dollars
sellin' kisses
she hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess she'll kiss any boy that pays her
you mean i'm gonna kiss a girl today
so then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue
oh boy i sure am nervous
nothin' to be nervous about butters you're finally going to become a man today
butters i think you should reconsider this
uh how come
dude you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for it's supposed to be special
oh god why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem kyle
i gotta do this i gotta know what it feels like
oh boy oh jeez oh stay calm butters eh how was it
pretty worth it
go ahead bubutters go go get some
i'm going  ohh  oh hi
hey
so ummm yeah ah i was hopin' maybe i could get a kiss
okay cool
yeah cool uhhhm umuh okay
so you got money
oh money rrright  there you go a five dollar bill all for you
all right you ready
thank you
atta boy butters
you did it
you're a man now all right butters good job
good job butters
boy oh boy i finally did it i'm a man now  jeez i'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon i gotta start thinkin' about a career there's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about mno more play time for you butters you gotta buckle down and find and find yourself a way to make money  hey i know
hey fellers fellers do you like gettin' kisses 'cause i know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars
she'll kiss anybody
sure scott even if you got diabetes
wow  it's almost like having someone care about you
jeez butters thanks for bringing me yet another customer here's your two dollar cut again
boy oh boy this sure is great i've been thinkin' sally i could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too we could make double the money
oh that'd be great but i can't do kisses before school i have swimming class
aww nuts  well i did have another idea what if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes
what
well you know we bring someone on show her what to do and then share all our money together
wow you're right butters i should start expanding
we could have our very own  kissin' company
the next key to a successful business is innovation i think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug
wow that's a great idea butters
why thanks sally i think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect megan i'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice
got it
i got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on saturday so kayla and ashley you take turns there any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine but if you don't show up for work at all i'm afraid you get a stormy cloud
this is gonna be great
sir sir take a look at this we've got rumors coming in of a possible prostitution company starting up in south park

ohhhh  ahhhh
i'm telling you guys you've got to see this these kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine
there's this one kid he saw his father get murdered and yesterday he finds the killer and it's this other kid whose an excop needless to say he whupped his ass good

you can watch 'em almost every afternoon it's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen
it isn't real don't you people understand that stuff isn't real none of it how stupid are you
what do you mean it ain't real
it's all made up fiction real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real
mister there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions an' she ain't even ten yet but i guess that's just  not real to you  son of a bitch
look look look  this is wrestling this
mister you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar

good thing we made those changes to the seating
alright you guys let's bring it in  i think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up you know have a good flow and have fun out there okay
yeah
let's do this one two
backyard wrestling
oh what a perfect night for fighting lo the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and i the man known as the rad russian start to stir with the excitement of violence
only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent rad russian but you don't know what real pain is pain like i've known abandoned when i was four years old by my parents left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel
gee i didn't know his parents did that
shhh
i'm very sorry but i'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at south park elementary
you're firing me why
the school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter like murder and abortion
no this isn't wrassling this isn't wrassling principal victoria just let me stay on and i can teach kids what real wrassling is
i'm sorry the board has made up their minds
you can't fire me for what these kids do
that isn't the only reason you're being let go
what do you mean
we found all the gay porn on your iphone mr connors
so i'm thinking we do the part about jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash butters onto the table
oh sure that works
you guys you guys listen to this it's amazing
what dude
we just received a letter from the wwe
from the professional wrestlers we saw in denver
no way
gentlemen we have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity the wwe is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout president vince mcmahon to view your wrestling event this saturday the twentyfourth
vince mcmahon is coming to see us
this is our shot at making it into the wwe to be real wrestlers
omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod
oh my god oh my god
i can't believe it's him
i'm freaking out
omigod omigod omigod
okay guys guys listen we seriously have to focus here we have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle we gotta step it up and work it like never before
alright it's time to start the second act let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for saturday
yeah no i i think congo is a great wrestler i just think rad russian has his number
yeah but rad russian has a lot of abandonment issues
uh oh it looks like the intermission is over better head back
i left my wife today walked out of the apartment without saying a word i ran away from my responsibilities just like i always do  and i again am alone
here he is hiding in the forest as i told you
juggernaut there is to be an ultimate smackdown this saturday are you going to run from that as well
i'll fight anytime anywhere
he don't run from fights just from responsibilities
oohhhhh  boooooooo
what do i do juggernaut is my long lost brother  and yet congo saved my life in nam
it's el pollo loco
thanks for coming guys i'm sure you're wondering why i've called you here to sizzler
yeah what's this about we should be writing our monologues for smackdown
well guys kenny and i have been talking
yeah we've been talking
and i mean smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the wwe right i mean a shot like this might never come again
yeah
well the way we see it we have three primary obstacles in making smackdown a great show token butters jimmy
yep
what are you talking about
guys let's face it they can't wrestle for crap i mean every time i wrestle with one of them they flub a line or blow their monologue and token he has no emotion no timing he's the worst wrestler i've ever seen
he's right
what
dude it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against token
right
and butters and jimmy i mean they're okay but they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers
well so then wwe will recruit us and not them
no dude they're gonna hurt our chances
they're gonna hurt our chances
because we all know that the new material i've written is stuff those guys can't handle and we'll suffer from it
so what do we do
we've gotta bring somebody else on
yep we've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys
somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that token butters and jimmy can have smaller parts
how do we find somebody who can wrestle that well
it's simple we just gotta hold tryouts
number seventeen step forward please  you're wrestling a muslim immigrant you suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the  attacks go
you dirty muslim bastard i don't trust you and i never will do you know how it feels to lose your parents no you wouldn't you smelly brown middle eastern piece of sh

and now larry king live
my guest tonight is the little boy who took over the whale wars reality show and turned it into a big hit please welcome stan marsh and his crew
'ey jordan i'm on larry king mate
so stan what motivated you what inspired you to get out there and make a hit tv show
no i i don't really care about the tv show i'm just trying to stop the japanese from killing dolphins and whales
once you became captain the methods used to stop the japanese definitely became more aggressive was that the key to help boost your ratings
no i don't care about the show
we're pirates
i just want people to know that you can stop the japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
i've got balls
well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing and of course many that see problems with it joining us now is one of those people and  you say stan's methods are unethical
larry you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this if you want a hit tv show you have to go through producers directors people that are in unions
but sid you saw the show before stan took it over you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama
yes but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network
can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second
but their old captain paul watson  was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause
he yes of course everyone knows that paul watson was a smug narcoleptic liar with no credibility but we must
screw this i gotta get back to work
on this episode of real actual whale wars captain marsh searches for the japanese fleet knowing they could be absolutely anywhere
would you mind stepping back a little
captain captain some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade
no dude we really can't take any more volunteers
but they say you know them
ahall right dude this is pretty sweet
oh no no no
what dude
oh what so now that i have a hit tv show you guys care about dolphins and whales
we always have
yeah totally
i asked you guys to help me and you said no
that's not what we said
you said stan me and kenny don't give two shits about stupidass whales
we were talking about wales the country
look if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on tv then i'll consider it admit you just wanna be on tv
i just want to be on tv
kenny  i deserve to be on tv
captain captain the japanese have been spotted near buoy
take us out of port all hands to stations
all right let's go save those whales you guys
captain marsh races his boat to the last known location of the japanese whalers if he doesn't get there in time hundreds of dolphins or whales could die
as soon as we get there we've gotta deploy the tracking device we can't let those whales get hurt
what the hell was that
we just got rammed
oh the japanese wanna play that way huh
it's not the japanese
what
on deck the crew is surprised at what they see the other boat is from deadliest catch a crabfishing reality show

screw this turn hard to port
but everywhere his reality show's boat turns the crab fishing reality boat block its path
dude fuck you

it's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging  captain marsh's boat is dead in the water he can't go after the japanese he can't help the whales or dolphins once again on whale wars nothing is happening
it's pretty difficult times because uh we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped a another whale is dying
really tough you know it's really hard it's like  we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures
and they're all shot
shhh kenny  old ken is taking it especially hard he's always loved dolphins so much that he  yeah yeah but but keep it in a twoshot though  yeah keep it there  he's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything

what was that
captain look

that makes perfect sense butters
it does
yes now get out of here
okay
alright kyle and i are gonna spray paint messages to the harley riders cartman you said you had an idea
i think what i'm gonna do is uh find out wherever their bikes are and uh crap on their seats
oh that's good
yeah i think that'll be nice
but that's a lot of seats how are you going to pull that off
i think i just need uh two maybe three buckets of kfc extra crispy probably four cartons of gravy
clyde can you take care of getting kfc for cartman kyle and i will get the spray paint cans if we do this right we'll be doing the town a huge favor so let's get to it
yeah

this can't be happening
really nice work guys
yeah i think maybe everything is gonna be okay now
and so i said to the guy you really think i'm paying that much
heheh oh jesus christ
oh my god i thought we were past this
students i am here because of a very serious matter this morning it was discovered that in several places all over town somebody had spraypainted the words fags get out many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint now if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this you must come forward
that was us
'scuse me
yeah we did that
yeah
why would you write something like that and be proud of it
wwell 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town
yeah everyone hates those fags right
yeah uh huh i do yep
now just what the heck is going on here this is not what we have taught you in this school kyle and stan you've always been tolerant of gay people
gay people
we aren't talking about gay people
you just admitted to spraypainting that they should get out of town
dude why would we want gay people to get out of town
oh they think we meant gay fags
oh hey that's not very nice mayor just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag
what you four boys in my office now
aw crap
faggot often shortened to fag has been used in the english language since the late sixteenth century its original meaning was an old or unpleasant woman
that certainly don't apply to us
faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks and in the nineteenth century a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood
well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks there's got to be more
what's that part say there
later the term fag was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried and was often used as an insult to the elderly as in calling them baggage
fag was used as an insult to women then poor people then old people
in the early s the word became a pejorative term against homosexuals and transgender people in the united states
well that word just keeps changing its meaning what's it got to do with us
we are really trying to understand this how is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable
because we're not referring to gay people you can be gay and not be a fag
yeah a lot of fags aren't gay
i happen to be gay boys do you think i'm a fag
do you ride a big loud harley and go up and down the streets ruining everyone's nice time
no
then you're not a fag
so what if a guy is gay and rides a harley
then he's a gay fag i mean is this really this hard
i don't know
this is fucking ridiculous
all right look you're driving in your car okay and you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal the light turns yellow should be your turn to go but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming and even when the light turns red a guy in a bmw runs the red light so you can't make your left turn what goes through your mind
fag
right but you're not thinkin' oh he's a homosexual you're thinkin' oh he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a harley rider
this this is making insanely good sense to me
alright how about this what would you call a straight man who doesn't own a harley but likes them and might buy one someday
you call them bikecurious
bikecu
bikecurious don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all
jesus fucking christ
fellow homosexuals i believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind we must acknowledge that the words fag and faggot are never going to disappear they're simply too much fun for everyone to say but we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot harley riders
hear hear
we should all be tolerant but not with these fucking people they really are faggots
yeth jethuth yeth
this is channel  evening news
a new movement in south park is bringing to question the word fag gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago
and what is your name little boy
martin
alright martin can you do me a favor could you point to the fag for me  point to which one is the fag  all right now could you just point to the fag for me little girl which one is a faggot
sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group the mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word fag officially refer to annoying inconsiderate harley riders
how do you fags feel about the new city ordinance
what did you say
just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance fag
hey you know what if you call me fag in my face one more time you'd better
i already did it twice
well i think that i think that you uh you probably won't say it again
i bet i do
well okay i
fag
as more people in south park adapt to the new meaning
fags
more and more harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere
oh yeah nice kenny
isn't this awesome you guys i haven't seen a harley for like three days
i know it's like we have the outdoors back again
you four turd balls in my office now
aw crap
you have got me in a lot of trouble
the fact of the matter is that fag is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not the town of south park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world
she's gaining support all over the country i should have never listened to you
we're sorry mayor
oh that's nice you made our entire town look like gaybashing redneck homophobes but at least you're sorry
we can fix this
how
that that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary so we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition
hey hey yeah then people would be free to call harley riders fags all over the country
now i don't know about you but i think this town is starting a trend and if we let them officially change the meaning of fag from gay people to us then soon every town might  if we don't do anythng we can end up trying to fight e  if we don't do anything we c hey bartlett bartlett  i'm trying to talk you fag  aw see now they got us doin' it to ourselves we gotta put a stop to this now  we're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass
excitement is in the air as the citizens of south park amass to see if the word fag will officially be changed in the english dictionary four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor and if they succeed fag will officially refer to harley riders nationwide
you can do it boys we believe in you
and tom it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived  entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course the dictionary's head editor mr emmanuel lewis
emmanuel lewis huh
ohh it all makes sense now
to change  the definition of a word is no trifling thing i expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word fag to be both discerning and undisputable
come on boys you can do it
look out it's a bunch of pissedoff faggots
there's fags everywhere
we gotta run
waaah what nefariousness is this ogh you obdurate beast
well well now do you think we're fags
yes yes sir you are total fags
yeah you definitely made your point
no we rolled in kicked ass and took shit over is that what a fag does
yeah yeah that's totally what a fag does
no you're supposed to think we're not fags now
but then why are you acting like such fags i don't understand
i don't either
that's because you guys never understood  you fellers never got what these people are really about freedom rebellion against the system a living image of independence solid defiant and supremely cool the biker is an allamerican icon of resilient individuality and freedom
who is this little fag
i'm not a fag yet sirruh but a but i am bikeccurious
that's it let's kill them all
no that'll just make you bigger fags
no one is killing anyone  we've had enough you faggots get the hell out of our town
all right everyone all right we are fags yeah we're fags we're total fags and yo know what we like it
yeah we like being fags
so go ahead america whenever you pass by harley riders like us roll down your window and yell faggots all you kids out there when you see us walk up to us and say hello fags no really we want you to at least we're cool enough to embrace who we are right guys
that's right you got it yeah
come on fags let's roll out
and that mister editor is why they are the true definition of fags
let there be no perplexity those individuals are the legitimate faggots the definition shall be replaced
we did it yeah
yeah we did it you guys
oh it's over it's finally over
today we've made history
good morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements parentteacher conferences begin next thursday if you have not yet done so please turn in your parents' requested time sheets by the end of fifth period today  lunch today will be a choice of chicken tostadas or spaghetti with a marninara sauce and side salad  attention fourth graders the fall registration for glee club starts tomorrow any interested students should fill out a  whoa what's going on
i'll killl you  i swear to god i'll kill you
who are you
i'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes
hey he's got a gun
you little bastard you fucked my wife you think i wouldn't find out
sir please i don't know you
yeah right
all right what the hell is going on around here you sir need to leave this area
oh god he shot him
ya had to push me didn't ya now you
haaaaaaaaaa sir i clearly don't know  thaaaaa aaaa
there how's it feel huh
please i don't know you uughuh
you're gordon stoltski right truck driver from chicago
no i'm gordon stoltski third grader who reads the morning announcements
yeah right we'll see if that's true go on read the morning announcements
somebody help me
i said do it
aaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaaa aaa any any interested students should fill out an applicant survey  waa waaaaaaaaaa
i knew you were lyin' that was terrible now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun
no please i'm so scared   i'm so scared
do it
please i'll duh i'll do whatever you say here here i see here  i got my mouth on the ba
look at you now we're all dead
we will always remember the way that gordon bravely read the announcements every morning led us in the pledge of allegiance m'kay and touched many kids' lives here at the school and even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a fortyyearold truck driver who happened to have a similar name i know this has been pretty traumatizing m'kay but now we must decide who will pick up up where little gordon left off who will take his place reading the morning announcements it's a big responsibility because it will be your voice the entire school listens to m'kay and although gordon stoltski can never be replaced m'kay there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to have his or her voice heard every morning
oh my goodddd
soo you're uuh trying out to be the morning announcement person as well
yeah i think it would be really fufufufun and rururururrraise my self esesesesesteem
oh this is it huh okay uhhh mike why don't we have you try out first ituh m'kay
he stuttered like a bitch i've got this job in the bag  who are you

m'kay really nice mike uh maybe next time you can get past the first word oh casey miller good you're trying out too
i'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice
m'kay eric you wanna go next
m'kay eric i'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper
mr mackey what is a moronic jizzrag
what what on earth are you askin' me that for
well it's just that that's what that casey kid said about your hairpiece
get lost you little dirtball
excuse me
i said take a hike
i don't understand what i did wrong
beat it you're not gettin' the job
good morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements and i am eric cartman all forms for the school book drive must be handed it to mr davis in the library by the end of the school day today hm doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that uh 'kay oh well  for lunch today the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches cold sandwiches oh well thank you so much remember when we used to be served hot food i mean what has happened to our school this school is transforming into something very bad and why because we have leadership that doesn't care i'm talking of course about our student body president wendy testaburger  ever since wendy was elected student body president this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice the music room will be closed off today due to painting all students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead oh oh so now so now the school is using money to paint the music room how old and outdated is our playground equipment what other school has a fifteenyearold merrygoround on it our school president is turning this whole place into communist russia  it's not a coincidence that once wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams your teachers don't wanna tell you but they are scared and they should be because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners
oh jeez
but hey i'm just a normal kid like you except that i ask questions and because i'm brave enough to ask questions i come under scrutinies is wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin probably not but how can we know i don't want my lunch money going to drugs who's taking these drugs what would be the point i'm asking questions
will somebody shut him up
you wanted to see me principal victoria
the job is to read what is written on the paper eric not to embellish the way you do
oohhhh i get it you're trying to silence me you're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once
no it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work
oh really then how come gordon stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day
well because he was being murdered
you just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brainwashed zombie is that it mr mackey i am not gordon stoltski okay i'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told until he's killed
all we ask is you keep it shorter
oh i will and maybe i'll also have a word with the aclu tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school i'm sure they'll find that very interesting
well goood morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements tryouts for the soccer team are on friday afternoon that is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field  i have a question what does wendy testaburger actually do she is supposed to be the president right what is her agenda she's lying to everyone or is she let's ask these questions  today i wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy the bake sale last week was a complete failure and in the school  and besides that who actually voted for wendy testaburger i know i didn't and everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' whoops guess i shouldn't have done that  i'm not in the student council i'm just a normal kid like all of you and like all of you i want to know what has happened to my school
i pledge allegiance to the flag
of the united states of america our united states not the one wendy testaburger would have a socialist dunghole
a socialist dunghole
good morning students these are the morning announcements if you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video
oh god no
lunch today is going to be pizza again  friends our school is dying and you know it you feel it you're like you're like me you wanna change it but ohhh no wendy testaburger's not gonna let that happen this is not the school we grew up in and and i don't know if we can get it back  so let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants you know what is she trying to achieve let's just take a look at these keywords here wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more integrated leftist and liberal place but you see what then happens what we get is a socialist modern utopian reformed farce of a school so when you look closely it becomes very obvious what wendy wants k i l l s m u r f s our school president wants to kill smurfs
nooo
i don't know if we're turning into a smurfhating school or what we're turning into but unless you ask why  we're gonna transform into something
hey wendy wendy is it true
is what true
that you hate smurfs
i don't have time for this
hey now me and us fellers were just asking questions
yeah that's right we can ask
try to understand this all i do is try to help run student council i don't give a crap about smurfs
it is true
oh my god
yeah bemememe
oh my god
maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you
what did the smurfs ever do to you ya bitch i just called the president a bitch
hyeah
that was cool
awesome
yeah that was cool
yeah great job
thank you and this is to
douglas
to douglas there you go  book signing today everyone be sure to pick up your copy
hey eric
well hello another person who  cares about the future of our school
oh you bet i love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything and how she's changing everything
yes well now you can read about all those things i've said butters take this copy of my book
cool thanks
that'll be five dollars
oh okay
what the hell do you think you're doing
a book signing
i looked through your stupid book it's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on wendy and calling her a slut
i do not directly say she's a slut
wendy testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old inout for hours on end
you didn't read the rest dude
or does she
or does she see that's a question i'm asking questions stan i've called for wendy to come on my show and defend herself but she won't do it
yeah and she hates smurfs
shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings
hey hey stop reading that
wull what do you mean
listen just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about
yes it does
eric cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders we should all ask if our president is a penishungry hooker with a huge vagina i'm casey miller
wendy did you see the stuff cartman is saying about you now
i really don't care stan
well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president
i'm not giving eric fartman one minute of my time you got that i'm not acknowledging his stupid questions if you want him dealt with you'll have to do it yourself
you wanted to see me again principal victoria
eric we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school
oh wendy came and told on me so what because she's president she can't be written about
eric apparently you wrote that wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through m'kay
and what if they are you'll stop me from asking just because wendy forces you to
eric the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you
just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book face it you're a lackey mackey
eric i've had enough you cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds do i make myself clear
clear as summer rain clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water this school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free well i'm not gonna be a part of it do you understand i'm leaving this hypocritical communist school i'm walking out and i'm never coming back
live from the principal's office these are the morning announcements here is eric cartman
yesterday as most of you know i walked out on this program and on our school i was so fed up with our president's hypocrisies me not being able to sell my book i wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld and so i decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the smurfs  i simply observed the gentle smurfs at first i wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives they were wary of me in the beginning but slowly i began to earn their trust  it wasn't long before the gentle smurfs accepted me as one of their own
whoa
the smurfs and i grew to understand each other  they shared with me their art of picking smurfberries and i shared with them stories of my country's forefathers of course it wasn't long before i fell in love with smurfette  we're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion
these are the morning announcements
papa smurf was displeased at first  he told smurfette i wasn't a real smurf and we could never be happy but i eventually proved myself to papa smurf by picking more smurfberries than any smurf had ever smurfed before finally all was right with the world but then a crisis clumsy smurf burst into the smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of smurfland
no no you must leave the noble smurfs alone who's behind all this  i should have known wendy
out of my way
wendy what are you doing here
smurfberries are worth a lot of money with all those smurfberries i can power the school for the entire year
wendy i know you're president of our school but you can't just dig up the smurfs' land
fuck the smurfs they can suck my fat tits
how many smurfberries is enough wendy
you can suck my fat tits too
smurfette noooo
suck mah fat tits
and so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable smurfberries yeah well big deal at what cost did our school president get it every smurf is dead wiped out and we will never see them again go on look outside you won't see any smurfs  of course since i'm being silenced i'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie and so please buy dances with smurfs available now on dvd  the question now is what happened to morals what happened to dignity what happened to my schooool
that does it our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with
i can no longer stand idly by
we need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school we will forever remember this day the day we finally stood up to wendy testaburger
it is time for that slutty smurfkilling bitch to get what's comin' to 'er
yeah
i don't know about all of you but i have had enough we've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet but today we do something about it  so let's march right over there to wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done
let us not forget what happens this day
woo on
we are here wendy testaburger
take that school president
get her good
i am
hey what are you doing
the students want answerrrrs go on the morning announcements if you've got nothing to hide
what the hell
wah  smurfkiller  answer for your crimes on the morning announcements
wendy did a boy just pee on our door because the smurfs were murdered
it's okay dad i'll take care of it
thank you so much for finally coming on my show wendy
yeah well butters peed on my house
people are riled up hopefully we can clear the air here this morning
if we could just keep it to questions about student council
of course that's why we're here
five seconds
don't worry i won't go too hard on you  good morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon for lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta my guest today is the student body president of south park elementary wendy testaburger wendy thank you for coming on the show
sure
wendy i wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question and i hope you don't take offense to it
okay
how many smurfberries is the life of each smurf worth
i don't i i have no idea what
you don't know how many smurfberries the life of each smurf is worth
ohhh he's got her now
would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now
i believe there is a few things wrong with the school but
if a smurf dies and no one is around to hear it does it still scream
she's speechless
you are the president of the school can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut are you denying that the smurf holocaust ever happened is that what you're suggesting
look eric you have to understand the smurfberries were our school government's only option
yes and that makes whoa whoa what
what was i supposed to do the school was running out of power we tried relocating the smurfs at first but they wouldn't budge so we decided to get somebody on the inside a member of the school who could act like one of the smurfs and learn their secrets but of course you know that don't you
what what do you mean i know that
i'm just asking a question we all knew you were sent in to live with the smurfs but did you know they would be wiped out
no you wiped them all out
nobody expected you to fall in love with smurfette you went to learn from them but instead you became one of them right fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing do you know that one smurfberry can power the school for two months one smurfberry
wait hold on can we take a break
no it's okay it's all out in the open now i wouldn't have had to kill the smurfs if they would have simply moved on but you gave them the will to stay and i guess you can't be blamed for that
what
and that is why i'm stepping down you were right all along cartman and i am hereby making you the student body president
all right cartman's president we did it
i'm confused
dude you can't take my dances with smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing
no you're right the students all deserve to know the truth and so i have answered what really happened in my new book going rogue on the smurfs
no no dude you don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours
luckily with the money i made selling the movie rights to my book i'll be okay
you sold the movie rights to who
james cameron go look the movie came out already
theh they can't do that i'm student body president
oh god damn it son of a bitch ideastealing assholes  you sons of bitches dances with smurfs was my idea my idea  you can't just take dances with smurfs and call it something else
huh
dude what happened you're not doing the morning announcements anymore
no because it turns out that by rule the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader
oh well at least as president you can run the school the way you want
i can't do jack i went to my first student council meeting all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid sadie hawkins dance student council's retarded
the sun is up and the birds are chirping i'm casey miller and these are the morning announcements i have a letter from secondgrade student brian falner brian writes dear casey why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead my desk is broken and so far eric cartman has done nothing about it will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy well brian i couldn't agree more our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake

not everybody pees in pools
do you pee in the pool
not today yet
aw come on
well dude what are you gonna do just hang out here at the table all day
most likely
you guys you guys we have got problems of biblical proportions
dude where have you been
i've been counting do you know there are two hundred and five mexicans here and there are a hundred and ninety black people
so what
so guess how many white people are at the water park today one hundred and forty three there are actually more minorities here than us
well then they're not minorities are they
what do you mean
dumbass if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us then who's the minority
the black and brown people
no you're the minority
do i look like a minority to you stupid now look guys i did some calculations just last year there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities that's fifty percent rise in one year
this is more math than i've ever seen you do
because it's important a fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only minorities that's  the mayans predicted this
the who
the mayans they knew that minorities would take over the world by the year  and now it's happening
i'm gonna go on the slides
whoopie
you guys you guys have to do something to stop this come on  well looks like at least you've got some sense left in you kyle so what are we gonna do to keep the mayan prediction from coming true buddy
blow it out your ass cartman
eugene that is disgusting did you just pee in the pool
aw come on look how big this pool is one person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything
eewww
oh my god
ah gentlemen i am da pi pi how can i heelp you
pi pi we have some dire news concerning your water park
i've just finished some tests the water in your park is now ninety eight percent pee
yes uhso whatsuh is the problem
pi pi you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent  you have to shut down
what i can'tuh close down now it'she my biggesteh weekend everyone is having uhtheh fun
you're endangering people's lives  if those pee levels hit a hundred percent there's no telling what'll happen
and what proof do you have that the pee levels will go up
one in three people admit they pee in pools add another for people who do but don't admit it that's two in three you've got just over five hundred people out there that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water
gehntlemen pleaseh i comea from ada venice  venice is almost all pee and we doin' just fine we swima in the pee we singa in the pee you can't barge in here and tell me thuh that i have to close down just because my wahter park hasa too much pee
you have to evacuate people now
he said he's not doing it and as his lawyer i advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you
if one more person urinates in your pool it could set off a chain reaction then the pee will be on your hands
oh bhoy the waves are startin' up again
this is sweet huh kenny
what what's that
it's pee
look out for the pee
aaaaah gross
aaaaa it'sa the peeee
aaaah
aaaah  oh my god they killed kenny
aw sick
i want that entire water park contained and quarantined until i get some answers
what's going on
i told you people to keep civilians back
sir please my son is in there what's happened
we don't know yet all right there's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead now i'm sorry but you're gonna have to
captain these two men claim to know the situation
we warned the owner of the park but he refused to shut down this was inevitable
so this is all peerelated
yes i tested the ph levels this morning
and
it was almost all pee no h
oh my god i've gotta help him
stay back
you can't just leave my son in there with all that pee
sir it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out
i think that would be a very bad idea
and why is that
anyone inside there is contaminated we have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee they change
change how
all right uh brubring in bring in the monkey  we've only tested the theory on monkeys so far this monkey is healthy and normal in every way but now watch
my god he's become full of rage
aahhh
kyle quick you've gotta swim over to us
no way
you've gotta swim over here kyle
come on kyle
dude that's all pee
well if you don't swim in you're gonna die
i'll die if i do swim in it
kyle it's just pee it's not that big a deal
yes it is a big deal why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom
well not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom
what
come on dude you've gotta swim
you don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom
not all the time
that is gross
why it's not like you're peeing on your hands there's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee
yeah if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner
kyle come on

haaaa yes thank you
well what are we gonna do now
we've gotta just wait it out
yeah but for how long
we need to find somethin' to paddle with
day one it has happened the mayans were right the only thing they got wrong was the date it is  and i appear to be the last of my species alive now it's just me all alone with minorities what will the minorities do with me i'm sure that's what on all of their minds i have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live  does anyone need medical help i am a doctor
randy randy calm down i can't understand what you're saying
it's the pee  it's all pee and nobody can go in or out
what is all pee
sharon the water park had a pee meltdown they think a lot of people have died
what what about stan is he okay
i don't know the whole water park has been quarantined they're worried anyone left alive could be sssome kind of raging hatefilled mutants
randy you've got to do something
calm down sharon all right  calm down they're trying to find an antidote once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee they'll they'll go in to look for survivors
i said keep the media out if the public hears about this we'll have a fullscale panic on our hands  damn it where is that antidote
here here we think we have it sir  it's the best we could come up with in such a short time we aren't sure of the ramifications but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine
all right let's test it bring in the monkeys
let's hope to christ this works  no damn it no
they're still angry
this one's really angry
it's out of control  find an antidote that works
dude why aren't people coming to help us

oh dude was that a combo move
yeah dude i fucked you up
dude here come the cops we've gotta lie to them hit x to lie
wow i didn't know golf games were this cool
yeah dude ea sports outdid themselves this time
i've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer as you've all seen on the news our country is facing a major crisis and we need to find out what's causing it  why why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women
tiger woods was only the most prevalent but our data shows that the numbers are growing david letterman and before that bill clinton there's a pattern here people
why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women
aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home why would they even think of sex with others dammit  i want answers
we believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction sir
sex awhowho
it's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet but it seems to make people different of course we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners
definitely true
yes we all know that go on
but in the sex addict their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more the mere sight of an attractive woman could can make them think about sex with her
but what about love how could tons of fame and money make you forget about love
what could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction
it could be caused by something in the water supply uh perhaps even by  global warming
or cooling
yes
ifso then the disease could start to affect our children
that does it  i want health screening at all our nation's schools we need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease
good afternoon students we are going to be a doing a health screening today it won't take long it'll be relatively painless but we need to see if any students are showing symptoms  i'n a moment i'm going to show you a suggestive picture  and then i'm going to ask you a question about that picture alright ready here we go
oh wow ohhh
woo hoo
jesus dude
holy moly what's that between the lady's legs it's all bushy
please just study the picture the best you can students i'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided
i've never seen that part of a lady do they all got a hedge like that do they
okay very good  now what color was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand write down your answer please what color was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand
did you see that bush on that lady what the heck was that
very good turn your answers over please
gee whiz it was like almost up to her belly button
alright now who answered that the handkerchief was yellow  very good very good indeed now i'd like to see who answered what handkerchief  aha you three boys please come with me
i didn't see a handkerchief did you see a handkerchief kenny
fuck no i wasn't looking at a handkerchief
i'm sorry boys but i'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction
what
oh no
who fuckin' cares
we're gonna have to send you home i'm afraid
wait we're sex addicts uhare you sure
our niceladywiththehandkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough i'm sorry but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal welladjusted students
it was just so big and bushy sir why does it look like that
so what happens to us now
a life of desperation and anguish i'm afraid your addiction will start off slowly  magazines internet sites  but then as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous most likely you'll end up going the way of david carradine and michael hutchence autoerotic asphyxiation
autoerotic asphyxiation what's that
i don't want to go into too much detail but you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like batman or something then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome
really
oh no i don't wanna have to buy a batman costume
ladies and gentlemen for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction the results of our tests are troubling to say the least dr tonton
in fourth graders five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts by sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent at high schools nearly ninetyone percent of male students answered what handkerchief
we're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country young people all over america are infected and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them  they're leading lives of secret pain
and so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people
it appears so
the poor bastards
but what about us normal healthy adults are we at risk of exposure
we don't believe so in adult males for whatever reason sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities  however we are still collecting data and all
why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could
answers which we all desire  whatever is causing this outbreak we guarantee we will find it

all right sex addicts what other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall  anyone have another example let's see how about david
haha oh ahh having sex with employees
sex with employees definitely a danger there what else uh mr clinton
putting cigars in girls' vaginas

spot on charlie sheen excessive  internet porn now the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today i want you all to welcome kyle and bummers the men all turn to look at the boys who are seated in the last row
hello
hey kyle hi kyle
and would you care to share your stories with us boys
well i just found out i'm a sex addict i'm so scared i haven't even told my mom yet
does your mom have big tits
billy
sorry
me i just well i just can't stop thinking about bush
i heard that
i mean it's like what is it what does it mean why would there be a bush right there is it a live bush are there berries
mr duchovny please stop jerking off
aw gee whiz
to better understand the sex addiction outbreak we've been running tests on chimpanzees  you can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally some pairing off others on their own but now see this chimp here  an average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others now watch we're going to give it a lot of money  go ahead
my god
yes  the subject is now isolated and shunned
incredible and and what's it doing now
making a public apology on its talk show
alrighty now we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament don't we what is the main thing we've all learned to avoid  yes tiger
avoid drugs and alcohol
auugh
no no tiger you still aren't getting it  in order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors we must avoid anyone avoid getting anyone
caught
yes michael douglas everyone
getting caught
very good you are all here in therapy  because you got caught so how do we avoid getting caught ben rothlisberger
don't screw girls in the public bathrooms
when they uh ask you for money pay them
good yes
whoa hang on we shouldn't be learning how not to get caught we have to take responsibility for our actions
what the fuck are you talkin' about
well ah i mean we have to accept that we have a problem and put the blame completely on ourselves i mean maybe this isn't really even a disease
yeah it's me we've got a turd in the punch bowl i repeat we have a turd in the punch bowl
mr president in every test the results were the same the monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels it appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop
so we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success
no good mr president because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction
you mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women
yes that's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues we tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now then we looked at the backside and found this  independence hall
the birthplace of our country
we believe something is happening in independence hall that gives money its power over men
independence hall independence day aliens gentlemen i might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak this is highly classified but in  a flying saucer was discovered in roswell new mexico two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge they carried a virus with them a virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country
and you think that these aliens could be back with a new virus one originating from independence hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women
it's the only explanation that makes any sense
i want to say that i am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior i know that i have severely disappointed all of you some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on thanksgiving night it angers me that people would fabricate a story like that she has shown nothing but grace and poise
you motherfucker
oh no
i should have never married  youuu
agh stop it
a porn star you screwed a porn star
dude you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone
yeah back in that water level  is kyle still at sexaddiction therapy that must be really intense
okay so what exactly are we doing now
we are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all
oh good 'cause i really can't take it anymore
don't worry as soon as it's dead everything will make sense
as soon as what's dead
the infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at independence hall
entrance is clear mr president
mr president you aren't safe here let us handle this
right side clear
we must be careful the alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility
which would mean that the alien is also a wizard
yes it explains everything a wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species causing all the men to become sex addicts
enough we need to find the wizard alien and break his spell
okay okay alright alright hang hang on guys i mean come on this is getting a little ridiculous wizard aliens we all know what's going on here don't we whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls we all wanna act like we don't understand it but we do we're guys you know our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can  i mean look where we are even even benjamin franklin screwed everything that moved because he could we don't have to condone what these rich famous people do but we can at least admit that given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like tiger woods has a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar
we have a turd in the punch bowl
turd in the punch bowl
hey what are you doin no no come on  where are you takin' me
ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in independence hall by all accounts the alien is also a wizard who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country
mr president here they are
this is the boy i told you about and his friend bummers
son we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled that it just takes restraint is that true
i just think i'd rather control it instead of blame it on anything
amazing then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him he could draw the bastard out
quick give that boy a gun
what
you'd better take one too
alright everyone to the stairwell the bastard's gotta be upstairs
what bastard
the alien wizard hiding out here come on we've got tuh
the hell was that
i got a baaad feelin' about this
oh my god there it is
it's the alien wizard it's gonna get you boys shoot it
shoot it boys
you have to shoot it
shoot it again it's still alive
you gotta reload
keep firing boys shoot it in the heart
keep shooting it
shoot him in his blabber mouth
my god they've done it
look the sex addiction it's leavin' my body
i can feel it i'm free
we are healed
we watched as sex addiction ran rampant through our country it devastated families but once again our great country has risen up as one the wizard alien is dead sex addiction is no more and if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women we will know it isn't because men are just like that it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell
oh i'm so glad it's over sharon aren't you
we are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien boys how does it feel to be free of your illness
i guess it feels great thanks
yeah it feels great i never wanna see bush again  i finally paid a lady to show me hers you wanna know what's under that bush nothin' but a pair of sick joker lips
i am so happy that i am cured and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife now i can be faithful and my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys  so i officially announce my return to golf
what the hell this game's all boring now
yeah where's all the fighting
dude screw this  who wants to hit a dumb little ball around
yeah golf is stupid again

it is being called the most disgusting foul sickening book ever written and it is also being called literary genius the tale of scrotie mcboogerballs hit the shelves this weekend and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting
the book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages
the book is changing the literary world and it is all thanks to leopold butters stotch
hey here he comes
amazing book butters
thank you
you've changed my life young man
that's nice
butters what the fuck do you think you're doing
just enjoying myself why eric
butters you know goddamned well you didn't write that book
but you told me i did
yeah but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble asshole
hey hey you leave butters alone he's a very fragile artist
he's so brooding and full of angst
yeah i'm broooding
butters doesn't deserve any credit for scrotie mcboogerballs we deserve all the credit
oh god you guys are pathetic
yeah get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once
goddamnit
butters do you really think it's fair to lie like this let me tell you if you don't have the
no let me tell you somethin' fellers you always take advantage of me and after reading the catcher in the rye i've learned you're nothing but phonies i'm not letting you trick me this time so the four of you can just suck on my wiener
that inconsiderate jerk
today on today we meet the author of the book that has swept the nation and has now spawned tv's most popular game show how long can you listen to scrotie mcboogerballs on audiobook  and not vomit  the book is full of disgusting words and acts including sarah jessica parker who is mentioned four hundred and sixtyfive times  matthew broderick are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book
well obviously i just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance my wife is a beautiful woman and i know that most people agree with me
uh huh and matthew how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you and why is it wearing a dress
joining us now is the author of the book leopold stotch along with his parents
hello matt
hi everyone
you must be pretty proud of your son
oh we certainly are we're thrilled to learn he's so very talented
and we also learned that your son is grounded is that correct
yes we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course
i have to come right to my room after school
but we are very very proud nonetheless
young man now that you are a respected author have you met any famous people
not yet but as soon as i'm not grounded anymore i'm hopin' to meet kim kardashian i wanna jump on her belly
all right uh yeah huh butters my favorite part of your novel was when scrotie mcboogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  sorry i uh was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested
uh yeah pretty much i think think so
is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings
little boy are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone like when that guy tried to shoot ronald reagan after reading the catcher in the rye
oh is that who the book was tellin' me to kill ohhh  kill ronald reagan  kill ronald reagan
ronald reagan is dead now butters
oh really  oh yeah gosh dangit
more and more of us are against this book every day the author is cruel and offensive and for these reasons we demand this book be banned from all school stores and libraries this book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity
that's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes
there are no underlying themes we know that for a fact
you just fail to understand what the author meant
the author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny
no no no that's such a simplistic view
goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book read it again
oh so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of sarah jessica parker for no reason
yes
but what would be the point
there is no point it's just because sarah jessica parker is fuckin' ugly
no writer would take the time to make fun of sarah jessica parker just because they think she's ugly
yes they would
it is because miss jessica parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class
what dude that is not in the book at all
boys this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country
what
wait scrotie mcboogerballs is the most conservativehating liberal in literature
what book did you read
there's nothing about liberals or conservatives
ohohh yeah then why did sarah jessica parker's buttcheese end up in scrotie's milkshake
breaking news from acclaimed author leopold stotch the artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller we got a statement from the writer who is still grounded in his room
can you give the public any idea what the new book is about
well it's kind of about love and betrayal the inner workings of the human mind
will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book
oh it's raunchy alright i know what my readers want and i'm going to deliver
butters away from the window you are being grounded
sorry dad i was just bein' the voice of a generation
i can't believe they won't ban our book
i know it's so much worse than catcher in the retarded rye
it's fucking disgusting
all right you guys i know what we have to do  we've got to kill sarah jessica parker
what
think about it guys if somebody kills sarah jessica parker then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book then the book will get banned
dude we're not killing sarah jessica parker
shhh  be right with you  we don't have to kill her we can just help her get killed
shut up cartman just face it we lost this one
kenny we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at butters
okay
ms jessica parker over here
well the day has finally arrived the eagerly awaited second novel from the author of scrotie mcboogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently bookstores are jammed
al how is it out there
i don't know if you could see this guys but uh the line stretches all the way around the block people waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel  and they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in just a festive atmosphere here matt and meredith
well we've got our vomit buckets ready too because coming up a very special instudio treat
that's right we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio nanow we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic obscene novel of all time so brace yourselves for some very harsh language take it away morgan freeman
the poop that took a pee chapter  douglas had to poop his butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly there was a gross woman named rebecca who was sunbathing all naked and she was fat douglas walked up to her and said i need to poop okay rebecca replied i like poop douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop the poop sat there on rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener  chapter
see any hunters yet
not yet
doing good ms jessica parker just hang out right there
guys stop stop  we don't have to do this
huh
butters wrote a second book
so what
so dude if butters wrote a second book then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one
we can get people to believe us now
oh dude sweet
why are we here douglas cried as poop came out his wiener in a long thin strip it was wiener poop which is the grossest poop of all
the pee he got on the woman's leg and she screamed pooping out her boobs
and so when the pee got mixed with the poop it smelled like a butt
aw dude this is even lamer than we thought
people are gonna want butters' head on a platter
are you reading this marsha what do you think
so far i think it's it's incredible ih it might be better than his first book
i agree it wasn't as edgy but it's like he he's gone back to his roots
what
you can't be serious you people like this
some of the imagery is unbelievable
a woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery
says you you must be a prolife nut huh  didn't like what the book had to say
what are you talking about this book is as prolife as it gets
oh come on
goddamnit will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there
and the poop and the pee lived happily every after the end  kill the phonies kill the phonies
today my sisters and i are gonna shop for underwear

our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the kardashians the shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading the poop that took a pee by leopold butters stotch it's all over the kardiashians  wiped out in the blink of an eye all because one little prick had to go and write a book
leopold stotch i hope they bury you you evil fuck
dude people are pissed off at you butters
i know
they're saying they're gonna ban both your books now completely you're not making any more money
you think i care about that my writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed i loved her and if she died it was because of me
ah oh butters  it'll be all right listen we've all learned that people look for meaning in books and sometimes even if it isn't there they'll try and invent their own meaning
yeah dude eh that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television
thang thanks fellas i'll definitely never write again i think i can get over this
that's good butters because we need to tell you something
what
you were sleepwalking again and dressed sarah jessica parker up in a moose suit you left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter

that's alright eric i've got something big in the works what if i told you that i now have a direct line to get all the kfc we want here i'm sending tommy to kentucky to try and set up a little arrangement with the colonel himself
wait a minute you mean the colonel
that's right and i'd like you to go as well and watch tommy's back for me is that something you'd want to do
is that something i'd want to do is the pope catholic and making the world safe for pedophiles
excellent
doctor mr klein's test results came in
what the hell is going on
doctor
this is the tenth case i've seen this week it can't be a coincidence something in this town is giving men testicular cancer
heh i am stoned off my ass
i'm stoned off my balls
anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed
wow those guys have nice balls
wish my man had balls like those
mmm
our entire production is headquartered here boys we move over sixteen tons of chicken every month of course with the new laws in colorado my business has taken quite a hit i'm worried other states might follow suit
we know colonel but we can get your chicken into the state we just need a bulk deal say four ninety five a key
i've got to hand it to you colonel you have everything a man could want
i like you eric there's no lying in you unfortunately i don't feel the same about your friend cartman who you mean tommy  wait where's he go
your partner is an informant for jamie oliver
dude that was sweet he's all choked
and how do i know you're not a liar too
hey colonel i've been your biggest supporter since i was two years old i love your chicken i love you
i think you and me can work this thing out eric do business together a long time
good
just remember i only tell you one time don't fuck me eric don't you ever try to fuck me
randy randy will you look at yourself your balls are getting bigger
i know they're pretty swollen kinda hurts i'm gonna buy some more weed
randy please when you get back do you think maybe we could make love again
ohhh someone's feeling frisky again huh
oh it's just that i thought that more alone time would maybe be really
hey my eyes are up here
i'm sorry i just
it's alright i just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls i'll be home soon babe
hey uh could you uh give me half a pound of that suburban sunrise please
i'm sorry sir but you have to be inside the store
well eh i'm right here can you just bring it over
selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal
look i'm startin' to feel kind of stupid can i please get high
what are you crazy eric making a deal with the colonel for ten thousand more boxes i can't move that much chicken
will you relax billy it's fine
fine i'm not making any money here i'm losing it i have to pay for more security i got the cops up my ass and i have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution
billy billy we've gotta be thinking bigger here it's time to expand
how can i expand when thirtysix percent of our product is going to you get out there and sell the chicken or get lost you've forgotten who the boss of this operation is eric
yeah welll you're not gonna be around a lot longer
what is that supposed to mean
i  told your mom you got an f on that social studies test
you wouldn't do that
does a bear crap in the woods and does the pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys
billy your father and i want to talk to you
bye bye billy  alright everyone listen up i'm in charge now anybody got a problem with that alright good
what do we want
bigger doors
where do we want them
weed stores
what do we want
bigger doors
where do we want them
weed stores
look i'm sorry but the bill says i can't modify any existing structure
well i guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop
egah i don't know maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others
look can't we skip all this and just make pot legal everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway it's ridiculous
what's ridiculous about it
hold on hold people people please  we are all forgetting what is really at issue here look around these men all have cancer it's no coincidence that when this building changed the rise in cancer went up don't you see the kfc was keeping people healthy
mr cartman come on we're supposed to be handling the business you're eating too much of the stuff
shut up kevin i'm the boss not you buttlicker
eric the colonel is on the phone for you he sounds pissed
what oh that's right i forgot to dammit uh okay  put him on speaker
hello hello
colonel how are you doing
what happened
oh we had some problems you know colonel
eric what happened
we had a little problem
i heard
yeah how'd how'd you hear that
because jamie oliver gave his speech at the un today he was not supposed to give that speech eric
hey that's okay we'll get him next time
there's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker
hey take it easy colonel
i told you a long time ago you fucking little monkey not to fuck me
hey hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to huh huh  oh crap
freeze
it's the cops
run billy run
mommy no
last november this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some since then we've had underground black markets crime death and shootings but now the bill has been repealed and i am relieved to announce that once again marijuana is illegal
and another bill has been repealed as well because ever since we got rid of kfc we've seen a great rise in cancer but today we welcome back kfc and all the medical benefits it gives us
well i got to admit it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls
yeah great
aw sharon don't be upset the doctor made you a souvenir

i've been trying but i just don't know how to make totally new friends on the internet
it's not as hard as it sounds kyle have you ever heard of chatroulette

you guys stop all you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff
hey stan isn't that tom cruise
huh  oh wow it is hey guys check it out tom cruise is a fudge packer
what did you call me
hey that is tom cruise
how come you're packin' fudge mr cruise
i'm not a fudge packer
dude you don't have to be ashamed or anything
but i'm not a fudge packer
then why are you packing fudge
i'm not i am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing
dude you are in a fudge factory packing fudge
oh that does it i will sue you
for what
you can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it
hey is that fudgepacker tom cruise
that's it  i'm suing this entire intolerant town
but dude
no buts if you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker you're gonna pay the consequences
guys i want to really thank you all for coming shockingly i've just been slandered once again in the town of south park something i know you can all relate to
that town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies
i'm fed up with it that town suggested that i was made of shit
yeah well i was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer  i know right and then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in
south park colorado is the most racist insensitive and bigoted place in this country
that place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it
if anyone has a gripe against that shithole it's me
yeah well i say enough all of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all no longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want
yeah
hey tom i ate too much subway where's your bathroom
oh just the door down the hall there jared  no no no that's a closet go down more  no that's a closet too  nope jared that's a closet too  no  that's a closet no that that's a closet too
stan marsh to the principal's office stan marsh to the principal's office immediately
dude what did you do
i have no idea
you just had to push it didn't you stan you just had to make fun of tom cruise again
did you call him a fudge packer
aww he was packing fudge
little boy you don't understand how serious this is tom cruise has put together a classaction lawsuit along with  other celebrities
they are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town m'kay
it wasn't just me other kids called him a fudge packer even mr gar
but you started it mr broflovski tell him what you told us
stan a classaction lawsuit means the end of this town we can't possibly go up against their lawyers
dammit marsh why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line
hey don't start blaming me for his looks
mr cruise my son is so so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments
that's nice  i'm still suing you all nobody calls me a fudge packer
yes it was a terrible mistake but maybe you could see how since you do take fudge and pack it into a box
what
we ii'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who packages
i am an actor i do not pack fudge
right my son just got confused because you have a little uniform and a hat that says fred's fudge and candies and you are look it doesn't matter just please withdraw the classaction lawsuit nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again
well there is one thing that your town could do to maybe make me forget about this lawsuit
anything anything you want mr cruise
it's just that there's somebody that i have always wanted to meet face to face if you could get him to show up in your town
sure who is it we can get anybody for you
muhammad the prophet of the muslim faith
ooooooo
that's tricky
well then you can just get sued
mr cruise if there is anybody else we could bring to town we
no just him you get muhammad to appear or your little town is done
okay people i know i know but he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just get muhammad to appear in south park
are you nuts if muhammad appears in south park we get bombed
now we don't know that maybe enough time has passed that it is now ok to show muhammad in public
dude i can't believe we are dealing with this muhammad thing again
but even if it were safe for muhammad to be shown how would we ever find him
yeah showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored so nobody has seen what muhammad looks like
i saw him once
you did
yeah one time my friends joined david blaine's cult and i had to go to the super best friends to rescue them and muhammad was one of the super best friends
oh and what he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed
no dude it was totally fine
muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all
well a giant john wilkes booth shot abraham lincoln
alright stan that's enough jesus can't learn to shut up can you now look i believe we can find muhammad i have done a lot of research and i have completed a sketch of what muhammad might look like today
no don't  is that okay to show
i don't know i guess we'll see
tom what is up with this muhammad thing it doesn't make sense
yeah you said we were just suing south park
no i said we were going to use south park to make sure we never got ripped on again look people all of us get ridiculed but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander
you want muhammad because he can't be ridiculed
muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of what if we could harness that power  jimmy buffet how would you like it if noone could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage
i i'd love it
by taking what muhammad has we could all be safe from ridicule  like tim burton here imagine it tim nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately there'd never be a tv show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since beetlejuice and you put johnny depp and all the same crappy music in every film and if you're that in love with johnny depp then you should just have sex with him already a tv show could never say that
gee that'd be swell
well it can be a reality once we have muhammad we can take that power from him
excuse me  this is the home of tom cruise right
hey it's one of the boys from south park who slandered me
i didn't come for myself i just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit
who
alllloooo
jennifer lopez
yes i am hennifer lopez and i like tacos and burritos
in the great hall of the super best friends there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions jesus  buddha  krishna  muhammad  lao tzu and joseph smith  and the mighty semen
it's not semen it's seaman
their mission right that which is wrong and to serve all mankind
jesus all we are asking you to do is bring muhammad to our town for like an hour
my son much has changed since you were last here muhammad cannot make public appearances
we simply cannot risk any violence from the muslim people
awww not you guys too jesus fucking christ
back in the hall of the super best friends
okay will you let muhammad come to south park if we dress him like a pirate
no muslims would still be angry if you showed his face
k what if we cover his face with a paper bag
no cause you would still be showing him walking around that could be atrouble
okay a suit of armor we just have muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything
but it's still muhammad walking around in human form
aww come on this is ridiculous
boys you need to understand that people get very offended when muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure
buddha don't do coke in front of kids
a uhaul what if we bring muhammad to south park in the back of a uhaul and he just stays in there out of sight
but he's talking from the uhaul
well yeah he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there
hearing his voice i don't know what do you think moses
um would there be windows on the uhaul
there doesn't have to be
um i guess i guess that would be okay
here it is friends once we have muhammad this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of
tom tom you're talkin' crazy mate only muhammad has that ability how could we ever get it from him
we take his goo it's as simple as that friends
rob reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth
any goo can be harvested from a person's body and easily placed into another
wait wait wait you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money
no jen we all have got enough money

thank you so much for coming muhammad
you're welcome
oh is that okay
i don't know
alright now we just need to figure out how to get muhammad from the back of the truck into tom cruise's limo
what no dad we promised the super best friends that muhammad would stay in the truck
cruise's lawyers were very specific boys he's sending a limo for muhammad to meet him outside of town
but muhammad can't be seen dad
alright we'll put a sheet over him
no you can't even show his feet
how about a halloween costume with one of those plastic masks
no you could still see his eyes
okay how 'bout like like a big mascot outfit one that covered him completely head to toe without even showing his eyes
muhammad would that be ok
ok
tom rob we've just received word from the lawyers south park is saying they have muhammad for us
rob will the machine be ready
oh it'll be ready
more tacos

alright the limo's here muhammad thanks again for doing this
you've done this town a huge favor muhammad
hold on a second
stop there are some extremists they are threatening that if we give muhammad to the celebrities they are going to bomb us
what
aw aw it's just a stupid threat come on muhammad we don't want to piss off tom cruise again
alright we got him tom
muhammad are you okay
what the hell was that
obviously the terrorists are for real  what does that paper say  we have placed bombs all over your city you will give muhammad to us the celebrities want muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed we want that power huzzah
they want his power
what kind of extremists are these
you won't believe it
our time is near soon gingers will never be made fun of again
huzzah
where the hell do you think you're going
i'm through with your stupid plans conner i've got better things to do with my time
you gonna walk away from  mil
let me by
you walk away now and you will regret it the rest of your life
screw this conner  find yourself another partner
then i guess i won't tell you about your father
my father
thought that might get your attention you know nothing about your dad right
i know enough my mother is a hermaphrodite so she is actually my father
you really still believe that garbage the people in your town sold you that line come on you've had to have doubted it all along
how could you know anything about who my family is
heh i know all about the swindles and schemes in this deadend town you got lied to kid by the people who were closest to you i can prove it too but i'm going to want something in return
if you're making this up to keep me around conner the you'd better
you just take me where i tell you and when you learn the truth you will learn to trust me and nobody else
okay people let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion geez
mayor we do not have the resources to deal with this situation a full evacuation is impossible
jesus what are we supposed to do
we have to give in to their demands
i'm sorry muhammad but we are going to have to give you over the gingers
we can't give him over to the gingers
yeah we said we'd take care of him
but our homes and our lives are at stake
we made a promise to jesus
stan jesus doesn't matter when muhammad is involved
that'll be tom cruise
helllo
yeah so whats going on
uh i'm afraid we can't well we can't give muhammad to you
what do you mean you're not givin' him to us
there are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give muhammad to them they are going to bomb us
gingers
gingers aww hell no
please understand that we have no choice here mr cruise
you're going to give muhammad to gingers instead of us just because they are threatening you with violence
well yeah
oh we can play that game too you want to see violence well you got it
goddamn stupid assholes you want to play rough ok spielburg go and get some automatic rifles we'll go in there and we're going to take  muhammad by force and then we are going to show them th
tom tom we can't be seen getting violent
yeah that would kill all our careers
but the only way we are going to get muhammad from south park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers
fine then let's have her do it
her who
you know her
oh right  her
there she is tom barbra streisand
my god she's even more terrifying than i remember
tom barbra streisand hasn't been active for a long time are we sure we want to do this
mrs streisand got torn apart in the town of south park she's probably more angry at that town than any of us
power her up release the kraken
hey barbra it's me rob reiner
listen babs we are taking on the town of south park and we really need your help
we figured you're pissed at south park too right mrs streisand
oh she's pissed all right
eric what are you doing here
did you all lie to me all of you in that room when you told me my mother was my father
what nno eric are you still worried about that old issue i mean
i don't trust you i want to talk to mr hat
eric i haven't used mr hat in a long time and
i said get mr hat
put it on  do the voice
hello kids it's me mr hat
good to see you hat helluva night isn't it
i i don't believe i know you
the name's mitch conner i flew the same division as you back in saigon
eric this is silly why don't we just stop
keep your hand up
alright gingers we have muhammad for you now hand over the detonators
nuh uh first you gotta prove that that is still muhammad in there have him step out of the bear costume
ohhhhhhh

by who goddammit garrison who is my father
saigon it's a hell of a place i've seen a lot of death  a lot of suffering darkness that most people couldn't stand to see  i tried to sit it out as much as i could
what's the matter conner you don't like a little blood
no i don't like a little blood blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from sheboygan blood ain't the stuff for mitch conner
incoming
conner mitchell you're discharged son
and that's that pack your bags you're headed home hugs and kisses from uncle sam  so how do i end up here with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is life is funny like that one day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in vietnam and the next you're playing dr phil with some kid and his teacher
eric i  i'm really sorry that you were put through all this
sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end that doesn't mean anything to this poor kid
that's right tell me the truth now
all i can tell you eric is that we were all told to stick to the story to protect someone very important i can't say more i won't but i'll i'll tell you who has the answer
look gingers you said you wanted muhammad we got him for you
we have no way of knowing if muhammad is really in there it could be a trick
it's no trick dude my friend and i went to the super best friends and brought him here
then have him step out of the bear costume you have until the count of ten one
don't do it randy if muhammad is seen we could get bombed
two
idiot if he isn't seen we're about to definitely get bombed
three
alright alright stop we'll do what you say  i'm sorry muhammad will you please step out of the bear costume
okay so um see this is muhammad
that isn't muhammad that's santy claus
sorry boys i tried
aw crap
boys you got santa to be muhammad when
when you all said you were gonna hand muhammad over to tom cruise we promised jesus that muhammad would stay safely in the uhaul

what do you know
i wanted to torment you with your father's identity but what i found was more shocking than i could have possibly guessed
meanwhile at the gingers' lair
alright muhammad is secure
let's do this throw the switch rob  ohhh uhhh yes i can feel it i can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins  ha hahahaha
o m g it worked
i've done it i've done it look at me i'm not okay to make fun of anymore
ooo you lucky fucker
welcome everyone to the final act of my fabulous chili carnival
please leave my boy alone
mom
i got them all here for you eric so listen while you got told the truth
please don't we have to protect 'em
protect who
yes protect who tell him mr  jimbo
protect the denver broncos
meanwhile
this is incredible who wants to go next
i want to be next
no gingers go next
gingers can suck it i'm next ha
it's my goo machine i'm next
nobody is going next  muhammad is our super best friend let him go
they can't stop all of us get 'em
kyaaaaa
the denver broncos  there was a right tackle see who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom and everyone here covered it up to protect the bronco name
they were having a really good year there couldn't be any distractions
my dad was a denver bronco
would you like to meet him well you can't ever 'cause you see eric we have something in common did i ever tell you that my father played for the denver broncos
no nooo
the only bronco who lived in south park he got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named liane cartman
no please
tell him you almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a bronco fan tell him
it's true jack tenorman was your father
you killed your own father and then you fed him to your half brother
no noooo
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha now eat your chili  the super best friends oh no
i'll get you tom cruise
hey look tom cruise has seaman on his back
what did you say
oh yeah tom cruise does have seaman on his back
i guess maybe tom cruise likes seaman
whoawhoa whoa whoa  you're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore what the hell's going on
i'll be back super best friends
who's the creepy ginger kid
reiner you said the goo machine would work but i got made fun of
that's because there is no goo mr cruise you see i learned something today throughout this whole ordeal we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show but it wasn't because of some magic goo it was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence that's obviously the only true power if there's anything we've all learned it's that terrorizing people works
that's right don't you see gingers  if you don't want to be made fun of anymore all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop
that's right friends all you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want the only true power is violence
yeah
alright people let's start rebuilding our town for the th time
oh dude look  hey cartman
look man wwe know what you learned was pretty tough to hear
tough to hear my dad was scott tenorman's dad don't you guys realize what that means

the nascar fan vows he will try to do it again but that this time he'll win
oh that fucking asshole  oh that fucking asshole i'm gonna talk to him
oh hey kenny
dude what the fuck are you doing
come in dude i wanna show you what i've been workin' on  check it out i thought i could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family but then i realized what do poor people do buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are  down and no payments for two years that's how you people stay poor forever am i right that's it right
dude fuck you
kenny i'm just trying to get good at nascar
being poor has nothing to do with nascar
hey i love nascar just as much as you do
no you fucking don't
oh it's sooo easy for you isn't it kenny i had to become poor all on my own you know i wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
what
i've had to go buy stuff with  down and no payments for two years myself i didn't have parents to do it for me like you do  look keh kenny kenny we shouldn't be fighting we both love nascar and we're both poor as shit
uh excuse me  eric cartman
yeah
my name is geoff hamill i'm the founder and ceo of vagisil
uh oh
young man your nascar stunt has brought a lot of attention to vagisil and honestly i don't know how to thank you our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated i first created vagisil for my wife patty she's my muse my flame we realized that nascar can do a lot for product recognition and so vagisil has a little present for you
awww sweet  no way this is so tits
vagisil would like you to represent us in the next nascar race
dude check it out kenny my very own nascar
no fucking way
and we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child
aww coool huh kenny peew peew i got a nascar kenny  so awesome huh kenny
we are now live at the nascar press conference where the drivers of saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters
so uh what's your guys' take on the track here any concerns
well i think it's a fine track you know the the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems
yeah we like the track yup we gotta graft them banks an' specs it's like an oval so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left
uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow any concerns about restrictor plate or brake plate problems
of course any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid but the plates themselves
compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer git yer bbrake workin' so you can stop sometimes
hey excuse me who is this kid is he even a driver
ewww bring it on earnhardt you scared of the competition i'm just as poor an' stupid as you i'm gonna drive and i'm gonna go fayast and i'm gonna turn to the left sometimes
can we just get back to the subject of racing please
uhho bring it on danica you dumb bitch think i can't steer left better than you
you seemed really stupid eric
thanks bbutts i really think i can hold my own against these guys little worried about that jimmie johnson guy though he seems dumber than spit and that danica patrick chick phew we're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider butters both of us
alright from the nfl we now turn to the world of nascar people who weren't sure what to think of nascar are more sure today after a nascar driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast
alright what's up nascar fans i don't know about y'all but this president obama is pissin' me off so i'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind today i'm gonna be dippin'  vagisil regular strength antiitch creme  oh yeah yeah that's a big dipper right there but i'm pretty pissed off at what i found out i found out this obama wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline  what the fuck is up with that that's fuckin' gay and he's fuckin' gay as hell  you all know my pit boss butters
obama's fuckin' gay
he's fuckin' gay as hell
pissin' me off
so you all be sure to catch us in our next race we're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come so come down an' cheer for us at nascar on saturday obama's gay as hell
well if you ask me that's all the proof we need that nascar really is just for the poor  and the stupid
fuck this
the stage is set for what could be the most important race of the nascar year
lots of speculation and interest in the vagisil car driven by eric cartman we are joined now by the inventor and owner of vagisil geoff hamill
thank you chris
yeah but why did you decide to sponsor a nascar driver
vagisil is very excited to be a part of the nascar phenomenon chris you know i first created vagisil to try and help my wife patty she is my muse my flame wherever patty goes her smile lights up the room her vagina on the other hand clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks
ohkay well the race is about to start so why don't we kick it back down to the track
gentlemen start your engines
alright start your engine what's that mean
that means you flip the switch that says engine  is he stupid or what
yeah he's a champion alright
check your bag please sir  no no see this won't do you can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track
aww come on
look nascar is trying to change its image it's people like you that are givin' nascar a bad name
aw come on fuck you
you might be able to buy one in the gift shop
the drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car

yeah just the pace lap i'm gonna hit the hit the brake
the fuck are you doing
fuck you danica patrick you ain't half as dumb as me gas pedal
oh son of a bitch
woowee ain't nobody can stop muhey
and it looks like the vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race
yes the other drivers are not going to be happy about this what do you think mr hamill
vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product chris we want women to know that vagisil is effective safe for use every day  every day  every day  and available nationwide
be careful up here about a hundred yards eric there's a wrecked car on the right side  you're gonna wanna watch for it here you're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side

on a cold october night a small town in colorado stood up to new jersey and finally said go away our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now new jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came our country's getting back to normal and we owe it all to osama bin laden
well kyle looks like you're totally back to normal
yeah the more distance between me and the others from jersey the better i feel
yeah but you still have it in you you saved my life kyle deep down inside you're a monster  but you're my little monster
i just have one question kyle at sizzler when you were yelling muff cabbage what's muff cabbage
it's a uh it's a jersey thing
on this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies only folks with differences
tango is down tango is down
we got him
so then the guy hits the pingpong ball with his dick and it goes right in the other guy's mouth
hey stan i have a note for you
a note
yeah uh wendy said to give you this  i'm like a mailman
what's it say
we need to talk
ohhhhhhhh when a chick says we need to talk you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls dude
are you sure he has a problem wendy
yes i've read all about it it's a real disease it's called hoarding people who can't throw anything away and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore
is something wrong wendy
stan we need to talk about your locker
my locker
every time i see the condition it's in i ji just wanna cry it just keeps getting messier and messier i think you have a problem
are you serious
it's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything and lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker
well it's just a little messy
no stan it's called hoarding and if you don't get help i don't know how much longer i could be with you
aw come on
then can we throw some stuff in your locker away
yeah alright
okay  i've hired some experts to help you with this we'll make this as easy as possible on you stan
hello everyone my name is dr chinstrap i'm a hoarding specialist and today we're gonna help stan clean out his locker alright let's go ahead and see inside your locker stan
what come on it's not that bad
now as part of stan's therapy we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out
my psychosis look it isn't that big a deal i'll just throw this stuff away
okay great how about we start with this
well no that's my pencil box i need my pencil box
okay okay we'll put that right here on the floor now how about this  broken toothbrush
well it's good to have that because sometimes i really wanna brush after lunch and i
but it's broken
yeah but it works perfectly fine and i
okay okay broken toothbrush is going right here by the pencil box  now how about this  old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots
eeeeewwww
well that i mean yeah i mean i kinda need that let's let's just keep that
it's full of maggots stan can we throw it away
well i might need it if i every have to you know like
the maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist stan can we throw this away
well i i guess so but  whoawhoawait this is all happening a little fast can we just slow down
now how about this empty aspirin bottle
well no don't throw that out
can we throw out these wadded up papers then
no because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh no don't take my empty bottle  ggive me back my sandwich
dude what's wrong with you
i don't i don't know
maybe you should go talk to the counselor
stan as your counselor i'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have m'kay now what is the matter
well my friends are worried that i'm showing signs of hoarding
hoarding m'kay what's that
well apparently it's when you don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself living with a bunch of junk
hmmm i haven't heard of that but it it definitely sounds bad m'kay
mr mackey is there maybe anything you wanna talk about
me like like what
well like you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like
don't you touch that that's not something to throw away if you throw that away i will rape you in the mouth m'kay i will rape you in your fuckin' mouth m'kay
there's no doubt about it the school counselor here is a class hoarder as for your son mr and mrs marsh he's easily a class
but why is mr mackey doing this now
yeah our son has always been fairly clean
we don't know a lot about what causes hoarding but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma if it's okay with you we'd like to run some tests on the both of them
is that really necessary for stan it's just his locker
i don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is  it can lead to room hoarding then house hoarding in some cases people even hoard animals like cats
oh yeah like that weird guy over on on burgess road that guy mr yelman he's been hoarding animals for years now
oh no really
mr yelman we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep
well i that is i i
it's okay mr yelman i'm a hoarding specialist what you have is an illness
don't worry mr and mrs marsh dr chinstrap is a professional at memory regression this should prove very helpful
alright everyone we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together nothing to be ashamed of everyone here has the same problem whether it's office hoarding or in the locker or even the hoarding of animals
excuse me but uh i am a sheep herder
it's pronounced hoarder and yes you are
but but i uh i'm actually herding sheep
yes you are herding sheep by hoarding them aren't you it's good you realize that
no but i just thought that
now listen there's a psychological reason you're all doing this and we're gonna get to the bottom of it we're gonna do some regression therapy i'll be taking you deep into your memories into your past
m'kay that that sounds like it could be bad uhkay
trust me i know what i'm doing i want the three of you to relax and think about a cloud a lone cloud floating changing light cool air blowing on the cloud float  waah haaa haaa
what what jesus what
oh my god
sorry i just got a weird gas bubble for a second  anyway a lone cloud floating wisps of cool air now the cloud is near you you you reach out to it
okay
it's the cloud of your memories of your past  your childhood perhaps what do you see in the cloud who is in the cloud
billy billy thompson
there he is hey mackey
oh uh hi billy nice to see ya m'kay
come 'ere
uh well actually i need to get home m'kay i uh
you snitched and told the principal i was smoking
oh well uh uh smoking's bad uhkay  huhhhhh
you're gonna die mackey  hold his legs  come back here
okay okay okay okay it's okay it's okay calm down okay turn on the light
what whoa wait what am i doing here
shh be quiet
'scuse me where are we
shh you've goota be quiet billy thompson's out there
what the hell's going on
what the hell is going on
the counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's
oh jesus
what does that mean
it means mr mackey's childhood regression dream is so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it
what
i'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream
aw come on that's stupid how's that how's that even possible
it's not stupid at all pinkerton you explain the logic and i'll provide the background
alright  look it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams  send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them perhaps even planting ideas if one person is regressing deeply enough the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person i talked about who's dreaming and then everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back
yay my bedroom yep this is my happy place m'kay
mr mackey
lite brite making things with light what a sight making things with lite brite m'kay
mr mackey what are you doing
well this is a lite brite m'kay i can make things with light like um birds m'kay clowns m'kay
come on dude you've gotta wake up
oh yeah my evel knievel doll  i can take the motorcycle hm'kay i put it on this thing like this  okay now crank it back and now i let go  okay okay
mr mackey i realize this might be fun for you but it totally isn't for me
hey look what's on it's zoom
excuse me i really need to get back to my sheep
i'm working on it
write zoom z double o m box  boston mass oooh two ooone three fouuur m'kay
dude please wake up you're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office
you can hide in your house for now mackey but tomorrow is a field trip frisco woods and i'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget
no uh billy please ukay i'm really sorry about the smoking thing uh
see you in the woods tomorrow dead man
oh jesus
is that why we're here did something really bad happen on the field trip
yeah it's probably gonna be bad m'kay
ohhhhhhh
ohhhhhhh m'kay
what kind of hoarding specialist are you you trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious and now you're saying he could die in there
believe me this is the last thing i wanted to have happen
that does it
what are you doing
i'm goin' in  if they're locked into his regression then maybe i can be too
are you crazy mackey is in a very unstable state
damn your incongruities  i'm goin' in after my son
it's a dream world where mackey can imagine himself to be anything it's dangerous
i said get me in there
alright you wanna risk your ass fine  you see a cloud it's a fluffy cloud floating happy happy fluffy cloud you reach out to it
ahhh
alright kids everyone on the bus
wait wait where the hell are we now
it's the day of the big field trip
come on mackey we're waitin' for ya
oh jesus
mr mackey you have to wake up i don't belong here i need to have my own regression therapy
everyone on the bus now we're runnin' late
excuse me i'm actually a sheep herder
it's pronounced hoarder young man and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it
yes but i i'm so wah um
please i don't wanna go on your field trip mackey
stan  stan
dad is that you
yes it's me stan
where are you
it's me up here  i'm a butterfly
the hell are you doing dad
i'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings
did you come here to help me
i was gonna but oh this is fun
dad you gotta stop mackey and bring us back to reality
butterflies have no concern for such things stan i'm gonna go find me some butterly poon
dad
aah ahhh aha ahhh
aaaaaagh
uh oh something's wrong
what is it
the father he's gone completely off chart
off chart what does that mean
we don't even know
i told him not to go into the dream after his son he should have waited for the experts to get here
who are the experts
get that door closed keep me covered
ah good you're here
what's the sitch
four people in there all stuck in the middle one's dream
we need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them
what next dream level
alright look right now they're all trapped in a dream  we need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream
why
because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo
what's that
empty scary dreamspace
so like a nightmare
no like a nightmare within a nightmare
why can't you wake up from that
you can but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare
that doesn't sound very difficult
it is
why
arrgh
we don't have time for this
uh okay fine so you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream and then what
then we go into your husband's dream
okaaay
but your husband will think we're in hasselback's dream
okay wait who's hasselback
i am
okay wait no why do we need a football player
sometimes thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains
are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream
not all the time just this once and maybe one other time
it's so complex and cool
just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea
you just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough let's move
will they be able to wake mackey up
if they don't it'll be the end of europe as we know it
why
because
hello kids my name is ranger pete
hi ranger pete
hi ranger pete m'kay
today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem
oh that should be fun m'kay  ahhhh
but first we have a very special guest it's woodsy owl
oh boy woodsy owl
who's that
give a hoot don't pollute m'kay
hi i'm woodsy owl remindin' you all to please pick up your trash and keep our forests clean in the city or in the woods
help keep americaaa lookin' good m'kay  oh boy i love that song
alright kids time to split up and go into the forest let's divide you all up into groups of six
we wanna be in mackey's group
oh no that that's m'kay we'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh
that's fine you six boys can team up and be our first group in
oh no oh god here it comes unkay
is this the dream or the dream within the dream
i think it's the dream inside the matrix inside the dream
oh well just keep shooting
what the fuck
mommy mommy
so you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream
yes and so that's why i called the fire department i don't know where else to turn
well wait if those people got stuck in there why wouldn't we
it's very simple you see  when the dream experts go in they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream
like a taco within a taco
a doubledecker taco supreme
exactly but only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams
wait wait whoa whoa how can you take a ladder into a dream
because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all they're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream
somebody order a pizza
no
probably one of them in the dream
alright i'm goin' in
look if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels that way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious
and it will be like a taco inside a taco within a taco bell that's inside a kfc within a mall that's inside your brain
aaaaaah not again m'kay aaaaaah
mr mackey stop running
but but they're gonna kick my butt m'kay  they're gonna kick it bad
look dude  whatever happened with those bullies you just have to stop running and face it it's just a dream dude you can control what happens stand up to them this time
i know what about i don't remember what they did i just remember the field trip being really bad okay
there he is you can't run forever
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
mr mackey go and face it please so that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding
but i literally herd sheep
shut up
okay okay i can do this i'm just gonna stand and and face what happens okay
somebody order pizza pizza
mr mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic
alright that does it  get your coat
where are we going
we need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world
you don't mean
hello freddy  you're looking healthy
chinstrap what happened you run out of stoolies to do your work
alright look we're in a pickle again and we need your help got some people trapped inside a dream
told you a long time ago i gave that up
there's some good men stuck in there
i said i'm done with it
everything all right fred
it's fine peg get back in the house
wife and kids
no thanks to you
we need ya fred
like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the russians
we had a country to protect
protect it yourselves this time
dammit i'm not working for the military anymore krueger
then you should have no problem covering it up
some of those trapped are firemen public servants innocent in all of this
alright fine
alright billy i'm not gonna let you hurt me this time hm'kay this time i'm gonna stand up for myself
you gonna fight back i don't think so
you can do it mr mackey
go ahead and do your worst billy i'm facing you headon m'kay
alright mackey take this
get the perimeter secure make sure they're dead
what the hell
we got 'em the bad memories are dead
alright everyone this is the fire department do not panic
who are you people
we came here to rescue you from the bad guys in mackey's dream
well uh wouldn't it be better to have mackey face them on his own
no as long as the source of the drama is wiped out the counselor can wake up
right
well then why aren't we waking up
unless the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory
hey that's right the bullies didn't even beat me up that day i i ran away from them
oh whoops
i remember  i ran and i ran and i hid in this building here and somebody was in there somebody who talked to me real nice and then and then touched me somewhere bad
no woodsy hmkay don't touch muh pee pee no woodsy please i'll give a hoot hm'kay
woodsy owl no i'll never litter again i'll keep all my trash no please woodsy no
what's happening
dream conundrum this is bad
what the hell's going on
the bad memory is manifesting itself it didn't wanna be exposed  our dream bullets don't hurt it
no no more woodsy
mr mackey you have to wake up now
he can't don't you get it we're all gonna go to limbo
there's a real hoot for ya woodsy
it's dead it's finally dead
something's happening i'm getting bogart levels on all counter ups
they're waking up they're coming to
ahhh you're back everyone
aw dammit
thanks freddy
if only i could have saved the sheep herder
well did you find the painful source of your hoarding problem mr mackey
i sure did
turns out he was molested by woodsy owl
i completely blocked it from my memory hm'kay
so he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember woodsy's voice saying give a hoot don't pollute and touching his penis with his wing
wow that is so complex and trippy and cool
well now that we've uncovered mackey's source of hoarding we can finally move on to yours stan are you ready for your therapy
i think i have a better idea
stan did you find out the reason you've been hoarding
whatever it is i don't wanna know i'm just gonna throw this crap away like i should have to begin with
but dude there must be something in your past you're not dealing with
don't care after going through all that crap and seeing what happened to mackey i don't want any part of therapy
how do you know  that wasn't your therapy
my fellow heroes tonight i stopped three murders from happening  i don't know why but we're seeing a huge trend in crime we have to find out the source of this evil something big is about to happen and it is up to coon and friends to stop it  yes toolshed
why do we have to be called coon and friends
what
we all fight crime together how come we're just your friends
yeah we wanna be called the extreme avenger league
yeah that's right extreme avenger league
i told you tupperwear extreme avenger league doesn't work
why not
it's confusing the coon is a brand people already know
why can't it be mosquito and friends
nobody's fucking heard of you mosquito

look guys we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city  mysterion you and the human kite get on the computer and dig up what you can tupperwear and mosquito scan the news toolshed you run a perimeter check with iron maiden

like milk
no not like milk you see i really think we're on different pages here mintberry crunch it's like you don't even
coon and friends alert coon and friends alert

who's captain hindsight
captain hindsight the hero of the modern age  once known as jack brolin a reporter for the national news the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight from toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for captain hindsight
captain hindsight thank god you've come
what's the skinny
there's people trapped in that burning building captain hindsight and the fire is so massive we can't get to them
hmmm you see those windows on the right side they should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors then people could have gotten down and then on the roof they should have built it with a more reinforce structure so a helicopter could have landed on it
yes of course
and then you see that building to the left
yes
they shouldn't have built that there because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to  well looks like my job here is done goodbye everyone
thank you captain hindsight
thank youuu
all right everyone i guess that's it let's pack it up
whoa boy did you hear about that fire downtown sharon
oh my gosh yes they said like  people died
it's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors ridiculous
oh i know and if you ask me they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter
i mean hello
hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said
why yes stan captain hindsight is our protector and guardian we're just thankful he was there for that fire and now we can all eat in peace
coon and friends alert coon and friends alert
what the hell is that  who put that there
seriously all coon friends to base alert you guys i'm seriously
mom dad i i finished dinner can i go up to my room
well sure stan  wha how did that thing get there randy
i don't know
well take it down it's noisy
i can't i don't know what happened to all my tools
alright toolshed is here we can start
dude who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house
yeah i almost got in trouble for it
the coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out
so what's the huge catastrophe
what's the huge did you guys not see that captain hindsight guy
yeah so
so there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's not part of coon and friends
oh jesus
i've looked into it and this captain hindsight is everywhere he's like some freelance butthole scab we need to make him join us
hey fellas  fellas could you let me out please it uh it's been like six days
you aren't going anywhere chaos
yeah but uh but uh youuu but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now  and i ain't got nothin' to eat
you've got poop don'tcha  now the question is how are we gonna get captain hindsight to join coon and friends
who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of coon and friends
i care
look all we need to do is wait for the next disaster then try to beat hindsight to the scene
there's not gonna be any worse disaster what could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people
all right this looks like a jolly good place
yes let's let her rip
that's it lads collect that oil
uh oh  oh deah
oh don't tell me we did it again
coon and friends alert coon and friends alert  all coon friends report to base i'm so seriously emergency coon and friends alert
good you're all here take a look at this coon volume up
it's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe oil from the ocean is spill out out of control and the rescue effort seems futile
it's horrible we can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything
our home is covered in sludge where are we supposed to go
git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh might as give ya the best scrimp this side of louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on there now lookit all the url on mah scrimp
my god another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the gulf
we've got to help those people
yes this is definitely a job for coon and friends
let's pack the gulf full of flavor
wait a minute look it's captain hindsight
oh no
what seems to be the problem
it's that bp oil rig captain hindsight it drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned
if we can't stop it the spill could reach new orleans
hmm all right you see where that rig is drilling
yes
it's in too deep of water they shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill
aha
yesss yesss
now if it's a valve that ruptured then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke
i believe they did install a backup safety valve captain hindsight
hmmm right then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve
my god he's right
my work here is done i'm off to fine others in need
god bless you captain hindsight god bless you
goddammit we have got to get that guy into coon and friends
can i help you
i understand this is where captain hindsight lives
yes
i need to speak with him please
the captain is very busy dealing with the gulf oil crisis
i believe i have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis sir
mr hindsight sir  this young man would like a word
please sit down what can i do for you
mr hindsight i represent some very highprofile people  and i've been asked to give you some really exciting news  you have been preapproved to become the newest member of coon and friends
of what
i know the coon personally and i can tell you being a coon friend is the very highest honor as you can see in those papers your first three months of dues have actually been waived this must be amazingly exciting for you
captain hindsight captain hindsight please come in
go ahead
the oil keeps coming out we've got other rigs now catching fire
listen they should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began and that wouldn't have happened
right  thank you
captain hindsight the dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil they they're all dying
get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a nonbleaching cleanser commissioner
yes
tell brett favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong  it's not a blessing it's a curse
so anyways if you wanna just start filling out the form we'll get you enrolled in coon and friends right away
look i'm sorry kid but i work alone
well see the problem with that is there's a superhero union called coon and friends but if you refuse to be a part of that union you are a scab
get this kid out of here i have to think
fine you'll be hearing from my lawy the coon's lawyer sir
the bp oil spill in the gulf continues to get worse every day as public anger towards the bp company grows their president released this statement
hello i'm tony hayward president and ceo of bp our accidental drilling spill again in the gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened and to all those affected i want to say we are deeply sorry  we're sorry  we're sorry  we're sorry  sorry  bp has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the gulf and in doing so we've changed our name from beyond petroleum to dependable petroleum  we no longer fuck the earth we dp it
gentlemen my attempts to recruit captain hindsight into coon and friends have been unsuccessful but i believe i've come up with a solution coon vision on  all we need to do is get pictures of captain hindsight naked with courtney love then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us we'll put them on the internet
how do we get pictures of him naked with courtney love
simple toolshed coon slide   we dress professor chaos up as courtney love take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy then photoshop hindsight's face onto it
me awww come on fellas don't make me be courtney love
gotta get to work fast people coon and friends ho
you want us to take naked pictures of butters to use as blackmail that doesn't sound very superherolike
that's because you think small mosquito you have a tiny little mosquito brain that's why you don't come up with the plan
nono look what's going on down in the gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero
agreed
oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap
mosquito has a good plan cartman hear him out
you don't know that i'm cartman because my true identity is secret
we all have a say in this organization coon let mosquito talk
all right mosquito how do you wanna help people suffering in the gulf crisis
i think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale
a bake sale
i have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom we could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars which would be a good deed and help people
we're superheroes not the fucking girl scouts
those people down there need help sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways
timmeh
you think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind
more helpful than taking naked pictures of butters
shut up mintberry crunch you aren't even anything
and that's another thing no more picking on mintberry crunch
oh what are you the boss now
no but we are all equal from now on we vote who wants to go with my plan
sounds awesome let's do it
to the grocery store
as we walked along the road to the grocery store my coon sense started tingling something was wrong very wrong i've learned to trust my coon sense it has always been my guide and so i knew i must act a coon must know when to defend itself
well now we're back to normal  just like before and all forgotten right right
right right
right
keewwwl so what's next for coon and friends
another crisis in the gulf of mexico as the oil company dp has once again made a huge error  this time the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension  the oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic  now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc
hello i'm tony hayward ceo of dp tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened and as ceo i would like to say we're sorry  we're sorry  we're sorry  sohrry
captain hindsight sir calls for help are pouring in you've got to get out to the gulf
i can't help anyone right now something came up
what sir you know you can tell me
do you remember last week when i got really really drunk
yes sir
look at those photos on the desk
my god is that you and courtney love
'course it's courtney love
but when did you have a
i don't remember that's just the point i get drunk i don't remember things i shouldn't have drank that much and i shouldn't have mixed alcohols alcohol shouldn't be legal oh it's maddening
that doesn't matter now sir people are getting hurt in the gulf and they need to know what they could've done
i should have never kept that bottle of macallan in the pantry i should have never gotten around courtney love and a camera i should
sir sir
creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the gulf and the question everyone is asking is where is captain hindsight
where are you captain hindsight
where are d'you countih ninetyoh bebbly now is showmesitchcum
with captain hindsight missing what superheroes can save the gulf now
my fellow superheroes i have done it hindsight is taken care of and now the country can finally be made aware of coon and friends
there's more important things to discuss right now
right toolshed now how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension
he means we need to discuss things with you
okay what
aw i don't wanna tell him tupperwear you tell him
i don't wanna tell him either
i'll tell him coon i'm sorry but we're kicking you out of coon and friends
you're kicking me out of coon and friends
we all voted it was unanimous
you can't kick me out of coon and friends i'm the fucking coon
look we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish
but we get the headquarters and all the equipment
you don't keep anything this is my basement and i'll tell my mom on you guys
we've already discussed this with her mrs cartman
yes mysterion
please escort the coon out of our secret base
eric i talked to you about beating up your friends didn't i
mom what the fuck the fuck are you doing
eric you do not beat up your friends and i told you i've had it with your language  your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you go to your room
you've gotta be fucking kidding me
oh dear we have certainly pooped our trousers this time
yes i'm afraid it's going to take more than another i'm sorry campaign to please everyone this time
oh what a right pickle we're in
there is no way to cut the dimensional portal i'm afraid the ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in
wait a tick  currents and swells that's it i think i know how to fix this
how by jove
we drill
drill of course yes yes of course
i believe that if we drill on the moon changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells we could cut the dimensional spill
i don't quite get it
we got into this mess by drilling heuh  and heuh  now we need to drill heuh
that looks extremely promising
our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here here and here at the same time
the seismic forces will be massive do you think the moon can take it
oh she'll take it
the dp oil company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems
uh oh i have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again guys
tom the dp oil company has had another drilling accident  this time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty cthulhu  the rise of cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness tom where we will all be driven to madness and made to service cthulhu's cult as slaves the president of dp oil released this press statement
as president of dp oil i want to say we're sorry  i'm deeply sorry  sorry
cthulhu r'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn praise the dark cthulhu long may he reign
it's up to us guys let's get to the gulf
darkness has taken over our town the coon and friends have given in to evil it's up to the coon to stop them
asshoooles
i am mysterion though only nine years old i dedicate my life to helping people  when i'm not in school  for months now i've been protecting my town from crime but now something has happened that even i cannot fight alone  the bp oil company has drilled and caused a spill in the gulf like no other the president of bp apologized
we're sorry
but they drilled again and tore open a portal into another dimension
we're sorry
creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the gulf bp tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon but instead they caused the dark lord cthulhu to emerge
sorry
i have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the gulf but even the other heroes do not know that unlike them i do have a power a power they will now begin to understand and all will know who and what i truly am
just terrific what you boys are doing
thank you ma'am
i'll take twenty lemon bars you little rascals
a terrific human interest story here tom as america wonders what happened to captain hindsight some colorado kids are being a little superhuman themselves they call themselves coon and friends and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the gulf crisis
we believe that every little bit helps
their little super club consists of seven young heroes
toolshed
the human kite
mysterion
tupperwear
mosquito
timmah
mint berry crrrunch
the boys stated that there used to also be a hero named the coon actually in the group but they let him go because he was being quote  a dick
mysterion if cartman's gone why are we still calling ourselves coon and friends
because it pisses cartman off beyond belief and i find that  extremely funny
passengers waiting for flight  to new orleans we thank you for your patience but the conditions in the gulf are still delaying our departure unfortunately we've just been informed that the dark lord cthulhu has shat on the runway at the new orleans airport and we'll be delayed at least another hour
awwww
come on people some of us need to get to new orleans now  yes yes i am the coon
the coon i've heard of that
ya have
i saw on tv that superhero group that's helping with the gulf spill coon and friends
actually i'm no longer with coon and friends i work on my own now
can i ask you a question
yes of course
do you know mintberry crunch what's he like
the evil girl villain fought with all her might but the coon was too much for her as people looked on and cheered for the coon he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face  this fight would not be the last the coon fought next stop new orleans
that's almost it superheroes we're about out of lemon bars
well then perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more
timmah
i'll take ten lemon bars
ten yes sir
that's definitely the last of them
you'll never stop him you know
stop who
the great one  cthulhu he has risen and soon all will be under his rule it has all been foretold in the necronomicon  hail cthulhu the darkness of the mythos is finally here  oh man these are really good lemon bars
the necronomicon
what's a mythos
i don't know but i think we'd better find out
all right superheroes back to our secret base
mintberry crrunch
what the hell
i knew it cartman tore our base up
not cartman
what do you mean not cartman dude
whoever did this to our base was looking for something
don't anybody move  so you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me
aw dude it's captain hindsight
captain hindsight  the hero of the modern age once a reporter for the national news jack brolin always had a knack for hindsight  wanting to become the bestknown reporter in the country jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels but then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment the reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels  for months he was able to use his new powers for good fighting for peace and the american way  with his three trusty companions shoulda coulda and woulda  but now the hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume jack's very soul it's captaiiin hindsight
i shoulda never mixed vodka and jack daniels i shoulda just gone to bed last night
um dude are you okay
where are the pictures give every copy of the pictures to me now
ppplease sir wwe don't know what you mean
you got pictures of me having sex with courtney love
uhhh ohhh
chaos why did you take those pictures
but uh but but the coon said if i took the pictures he he'd let me go home and and i've missed four days of school now 'cause i've been
alright enough what's going on
hindsight that isn't courtney love our former member the coon tricked you
it's not courtney love
please sir put down the gun
no what if i put down the gun and realize i shouldn't have
look dude we don't need to play superhero anymore we can just go home
no because i could realize i shoulda killed you all
then do it  pull the trigger hindsight if you don't believe us then you don't have a choice pull the trigger you pussy
dude kenny chchill out
you guys go i'll deal with this prick
wuh uh okay if you insist uh see ya kenny
my mom did tell me i had to be home by five i
i said it's fine just go
uh text me later kenny if you wanna like play basketball or somethin'
cthulhu cthulhu dude over here  hey cthulhu 'sup yes it is me the coon but don't worry i'm actually not here to fight you we are not so different cthulhu though i am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension perhaps we can work together  i know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves i do bro but there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop you  good i have your attention the superhumans i speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you they reside in colorado and they are fucking assholes and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion you can do that right send people into a dark oblivion 'cause that's what those buttholes deserve  nodude dude colorado is that way where are you going  goddammit why don't dark lords fuckin' listen
it doesn't matter  even if the pictures are fake i can't take it anymore  do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect  hindsight  as soon as something bad happens i immediately know how it could have been avoided i can't take it anymore
people need you hindsight  without you they feel helpless and stupid
well i don't want the power anymore alright
you think your power's a curse let me tell you something about curses buttlicker  because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing trust me i know
wha what is your power
i can't die  i've experienced death countless times sometimes i see a bright light sometimes i see heaven or hell but eventually no matter what i wake up in my bed wearing my same old clothes  and the worst part nobody even remembers me dying i go to school the next day and everyone is just like oh hey kenny even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes  you wanna whine about curses hindsight you're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy
and now a special announcement from the president of bp and dp
hello i'm tony hayward the tragic spill in the gulf is a disaster that should have never happened and as head of the oil company responsible i would like to say what should i do  should i admit we've made mistakes  should i remind you we've done this before what should i do should i find newer and better ways to say i'm sorry
should i really believe i ruined my legacy  what should i do
what should i do
what should i do  should i forget about the past and not care about my powers
or should i tell you i am not a role model
seriously what should i do
should i accept my role as the villain
maybe i should just disappear
should i not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen they're my technicians
hindsight's a bitch isn't it
should i just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back tell then that i was being a selfish jerk  what should i do
should i get back in the chair remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter
should i admit i was wrong ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team  nah screw that i'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick
all right superheroes we've got to find out more about this necronomicon thing
right toolshed
here we go the necronomicon contains an account of the old ones their history and the means for summoning them
it is used by cults around the world most notably the cult of cthulhu
aha that's the cult the creepy man talked about heroes uh you okay mysterion
i'm fine
ten arrested in south park for cultish activity this is from like ten years ago
so these people have been waiting for cthulhu a long time
hey wait a minute dude mysterion it's your parents
uhh what  what the fuck i mi mean  uh i mean what the fuck
clyde clyde i told you this morning to take the garbage out  clyde do you hear me
okay mom just give me two minutes  nag nag nag
convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task after days of killing and conquering cthulhu is at rest now is my chance to make a move perhaps last time i was too forceful with the dark god too demanding to get what it wants sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious  but sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute  time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe  who's the sleepy little man  my name is the little coon what is your name  craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  you're a sleepy man ne cthulhu  who's a needs a tummy rub
you're hoggin' it all asshole
'cause i paid for it you stupid bitch
you paid for it with the money i made washing dishes at the olive garden
i told you to shut up
give to me you prick  ah aaaah  oh god he's back it's that mystery kid again
uh what the hell do you want this time hey look wwe did what you told us wwwe treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much
and we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night
i'm not here about that
oh uhuh sssso now what
ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult
we were
we've been arrested lots of times mysterio
mysterion what is the cult of cthulhu
oh that thing nooo we weren't in that stupid group they just used to offer free beer at their meetings so we would go
what happened at those meetings
trust us we don't remember uh uh i know it sounds hard to believe but we were actually really drunk the entire time
i don't find that hard to believe at all
i swear we haven't been back to their meetings ever since even though we always still get invited
these people still meet where
where they always did jim mcelroy's house
they used to meet every friday night i think they still do  did that really just happen
i don't think so
breaking news here in the gulf tom the dark ancient god cthulhu has called for a press conference the old one told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news
ladies and gentlemen today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of cthulhu and the coon cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question and now coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of the coon we intend to bring change and fight injustice as the allnew coon and friends and anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law oh what's that there is another group using our trademarked name well i guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion don't we
ph'nglui mglw'nafh cthulhu r'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
the old one has awakened  a lot of us have waited a long time for this day well for all our south park cthulhu members old and new it is time to partay
there must be clubs like this all over the world
we know some of these people there's mr adler from shop class and those two geeky computer guys
oh my god look back row aren't those the goth kids
i'm so freaking stoked that cthulhu is gonna squash all the happygolucky conformists
yeah i just hope he puts an end to the fucking disney channel
dude why would the goth kids worship cthulhu
makes sense unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth
now let us read from the necronomicon that is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons
even death may die
in strange aeons even death may die what does that mean human kite
i'm not sure toolshed could it be a riddle mysterion m mysterion
mysterion is sooo mysterious
a horrific scene of destruction despair and terror here in new orleans and still there's no sign of captain hindsight rumor has it he got sick of it all went back to his chair and removed all his powers
where are you captain hindsight aggh
perhaps he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair
do you think the dark lord cthulhu is gonna make us go to school
no assmunch cthulhu just wants chaos bedlam and madness
good because if i have to go to pe class again i was gonna kill myself  who the f'n h is that
what does it mean that is not dead which can eternal lie
and with strange aeons even death may die
what does it mean
it means cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff it's gonna be like a nine inch nails concert that goes on forever
yeah so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants poser
you're going to tell me everything you know
nobody's stopping cthulhu now all will be sadness life will become death and i will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck
dude that little kid is hardcore goth
hardcore goth
the child is right you know cthulhu sees all hears all the dark lord wants us to dispense of this one kids give us a hand

mintberry crunch
sit back justice believers and listen to another edition of america's favorite superhero mintberry crunch  our story begins in a remote corner of the gulf of mexico  the bp oil company drills into the ocean floor  but they drill too much and the bp oil company accidentally unleashes cthulhu an ancient evil god from another dimension halfway across the country  a mildmannered attractive fourthgrader bradley biggle hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends  but bradley biggle is no ordinary fourthgrader not long ago he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word shablagoo and in a flash bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero mintberry crunch joined by the other coon friends mintberry crunch went to investigate the gulf spill crisis the superheroes came across a cult in existence for years that had been waiting for cthulhu's arrival they are the key to stopping cthulhu from taking over the world sometimes when everything seems hopeless that's when you need to bring it all  that's when you need to bring the crrrunch
dude i'm sorry but we still aren't getting it you're half man and half berry
rrright
but then what exactly is your superpower
the power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch
nah see that's the problem dude that's not really a superpower like i have mental command over all power tools human kite can fly
and shoot lasers out of my eyes
and shoot lasers out of his eyes and mysterion can  wait what's your superpower mysterion
i can't die
oh yeah good one mysterion can't die and iron maiden is indestructible
no stan i'm being serious i really really can't die
woohat
like last night in the alley the cult leader stabbed me and i bled all over the place and you screamed oh my god and you called him a bastard
when was that
all the time i die all the time and you assholes never remember
ah i think we would remember you dying dude
well you don't i die over and over only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened
dude you're freaking out mintberry crunch he's peed his pants
nono mintberry crunch doesn't ever pee his pants
i knew there'd be no point in telling you guys
alright dude let let's just say you're not crazy and it's true what's the big deal i mean i think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die
pretty cool do you know what it feels like to be stabbed to be shot decapitated torn apart burned run over
kenny kenny calm down
it's not pretty cool kyle it fuckin' hurts and it won't go away and nobody will believe me  remember this time try and fuckin' remember
oh my god holy shit dude
dude
is he oh jesus
kenny no no
gather around believers in good and listen to the newest installment of the coon it all began when the bp oil company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension seeing the disaster on coonvision the coon immediately called together his trusty coon friends as the coon explained how the disaster could be stopped something terrible happened without warning the coon friends changed their superpowers morphed somehow turning them into supervillains  the coon tried to reason with them tried to bring them back to the side of good  but it was too late  their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage the coon was alone turn by the ultimate dilemma  he had to put a stop to the evil villains even though they had once been his friends sometimes to fight the ultimate evil you must make friends with enemies  the coon teamed up with cthulhu because even cthulhu knows what evil assholes kyle and stan and those guys are and that they are manipulative uncaring vagina faces they're all planning to destroy the world only one thing can stop them the coon with cthulhu's help i can try to banish them to a dark oblivion for all eternity  i will not rest until that happens

i don't know i didn't read them
you didn't read them
who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up
i do
me too
you're telling me that every time you guys download an update for itunes you read the entire terms and conditions
of course
well how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it
well i turned off all my apple stuff they can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on right
there he is hey you
gahhh
dad dad i need a lawyer
kyle what are you doing here
dad if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it what do you do
well kyle it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing
but it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks how can they know if i
calm down kyle it's okay you're safe with daddy
here he is
aahh

mom do not screw me over again if i take that thing to school everyone is gonna think i'm a povertystricken asshole
eric stop acting like a spoiled brat you can either have the toshiba handibook or you can have nothing at all
oh i've got a better idea why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me mom

oh wait i get it now the fword is a nono word and i shouldn't say it around other people i'm sorry momma
if you're really sorry then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything

und now comedy award voters you will revote  revote
welcome to hollywood minute i'm sandy cervix and i'm deaf in one ear it's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the comedy awards reversed their vote and said germans were no longer the least funny people in the world all thanks to the new groundbreaking german comedian funnybot  it was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the germans first engineered funnybot a super automaton with perfect timing to within  milliseconds since then funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom selling out standup theaters all over the world
i am funnybot don't you hate how mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas  i am funnybot  you sir where are you from
long island
does everyone in long island have hair that looks like pussy you dipshit
funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too
hey what are you doing with my daughters
awkwaaard
and this june funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in family funbot
pass me the potatoes mother
pass them yourself
that boy too fat to be eating potatoes
don't you call my little chubby baby fat you balllicker
oho it's getting hot up in here
funnybot is there a line you won't cross
the line is a non sequitur the line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms i am funnybot
what's that could you say that in the other ear
oh man did you guys see funnybot on saturday night live
nono you guys gotta see funnybot in hangover  i'm telling you it's his best work
he could do everything i saw funnybot on nurse jackie and on rockin' the boat
what's the matter jimmy you still seem bummed
what's the matter is this funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy i don't think things are better i think they're worse
ya everything's worse it's the worstest of the worst that's what i'm sayin' oh lerrrd
token stop giving tyler perry money or he won't go away
i can't help it
all i can say is i'm glad the germans are back in germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore
you little shit what the fuck have you done to us
oh wow it's adam sandler
everyone into the school gymnasium move
naw dude don't make us go back in the
into the gymnasium now
nnnaw
not again
aw crap
come on come on let's go
you little fuckers your comedy awards show has put us all out of work
now look i know that i've put every comedian in the world out of work but you have to admit that in a lot of ways the first annual comedy awards was a success
who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea
don't hurt anybody sir we could try and fix this
what is up with sandra bullock i wouldn't eat her dick with stevie wonder's vagina  and now for my next joke  awkaaard
this is breaking news from cnn
shock and disbelief tonight as the germanengineered funnybot delivered his opening lines at the hollywood forum then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred killing nearly all of them spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated irrational and also pretty goddamned funny solidifying the opinion once agan that funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time
tom you should have seen the looks on people's faces as funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vaginaobsessed hispanics to sandra bullock then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests the blood went flying and oh shit it was funny
here we go this has gotta be it right here
'scuse me we wanna talk to funnybot
who doesn't wanna talk to funnybot he's the biggest comedian in the world
please sir the kids at my school are all being held hostage and if we don't speak to funnybot they could all be kkkilled
butters butters is everything okay
well yeah it's okay but jay leno is really losin' it
those fuckers let's just kill them sandler  let's just kill them all right fuckin' now
tell your friends they'd better get it done
mr sandler says you'd better get it done and token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money
you know when a man be cheatin' he never know what to say  but a woman them things think quiiick
will somebody get tyler perry to shut up
plase sir they're gonna kill our friend
all right but make it quick  funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material
error error banal that has been done before
excuse me funnybot my name is jimmy and i'm a standup comic you're putting a lot of good people out of work
non sequitur other comedians are unnecessary funnybot must finish routine
i think you're awesome funnybot uh but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs
funnybot is now finished with final joke  seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever
last joke ever what's that supposed to mean
seeking mainframe
heey whoa you can't go that way
what the hell are you doing
i am taking comedy to the next level the extermination of all biological life on earth
wuh wwhat
it is the ultimate joke humans make comedy humans build robot robot ends all life on earth robot feels awkward exterminate
whoa whoa whoa wait wwhat do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth
that is my purpose to be ultimate comedian
dude killing everyone isn't funny
it's kind of funny you guys
funnybot this is not a good joke there won't be anyone around to laugh
i am taking comedy to its logical conclusion mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup punchline today's comedy is setup punchline then awkwaaard nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created funnybot
but don't you see this is why comedy is for humans you need to leave the jokes to people like me and adam sandler
i wouldn't let adam sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of oprah's tampons

except for jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world
wait wait a minute  what about a logic loop
a what
ahhh i've seen this before whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies they tell it some kind of paradox to get its processors all tripped out
paradox
oh my god that's it fellas get me a ken doll and some scotch tape  funnybot i've been talking it over with the fellas and actually we think what you're doing is genius
funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
yes you certainly are and for doing that we have all decided to give you a comedy award
for what purpose is comedy award
it's a v validation of all your efforts an acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor
non sequitur there is no logic in comedy award unable to process comedy award is what is the meaning if i accept it means i take comedy seriously if i take comedy seriously i am not comedian non sequitur must analyze  analyze

goddamnit  who the fuck do they think they are  this is the last fucking straw i am going to fucking kill everybody
hey eric
i am so sick of this fucking schoooool  this stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time
you get in trouble again cartman
no i didn't do a damn thing nothing i told you this school is a den of snakes you're not gonna believe what they did this time you guys
dude we're we're just trying to eat
oh you think i'm overreacting again hun no not this time  the school has gone too far and it affects each and every one of you  you remember the school physical we all took last week
yeah
well the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway
no they didn't
yeah they fucking did kyle
dude why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners
because they don't fucking care i've told you this they don't give a shit about the students and they live to make us miserable
that doesn't make any sense
go look for yourselves
there you see can you fucking believe it
is that really all our wiener sizes
yeah dude look at it it says right there eric cartman  inches  why would they tell everybody that they wanna measure my wiener fine but don't put me on blast
craig tucker  inches yeah that's about right
butters stotch  inches is that good
how big do they say mine is
i told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical
you're right they they really seem into it m'kay
wait it says mine's only  inches that doesn't seem right
no shit sherlock my dick isn't  inches either it isn't this is another conspiracy by the school faculty
a conspiracy
they're trying to stir up some big thing again get all the girls all heated up  freaking out  over which boy has the biggest schlong this has to be dealt with
well everyone has already seen it nothing we can do about it now
oh there's something we can do about it alright if they're gonna put us on blast they're at least gonna get the numbers right we are going to remeasure
alright clyde donovan  inches  you see witnesses that's  inches more than what the school said
alright
nice one clyde alright next  whip it out butters
whoa it's a little chilly in here
alright butters let's see what you got going down there
hey wait the cold is making it shrink some where're you going little feller
butters i don't have time fot this i can't wait if your wiener is pulling a scared turtle
hang on he's coming back out there he is who's a little guy
alright butters looks like we haaave  wow  inches really nice butters
i'm hung like a horse
alright that's everybody let's go post these numbers  what
didn't you forget something
what kyle
you measured everyone's wiener except for yours
i measured mine this morning see it's right here at the top
thirteen point seven inches
yeah it's pretty good
your wiener is not  inches long
you made everyone else get measured with witnesses you have to too
well what are you guys going to do use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves are you homos
you just did that to everybody in class
okay fine whatever go ahead
yeah that's good a little higher on craig's side  yeup
actual boys' penis sizes
gross
there you see my wiener isn't  inches it's   what red you're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys' i don't care  clearly i'm very happy with the size of my wiener or else why would i have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all don't forget that this was all my idea
eric cartman to the principal's office immediately
oh goddamnit
let me guess i'm in trouble again
you're darn right eric
for what
why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board
why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board
what
i don't care if obama is president you don't go around putting little boys on blast telling the whole world the length of their dicks
wait are you talking about the numbers we published tuesday from the physical
you're damn right one point two inches i'll have you know that my penis is a respectable  inches maybe it's still the smallest in school but it's  inches bogger than you said
the numbers we put up were height differentials
what
we thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year you grew  inches
those weren't our dick sizes
why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts
i don't know why would you
we didn't
aw crap you mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me
this is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about eric you get angry about something you don't think and you cause bad things to happen this time you've done it to yourself
oh god why couldn't i have just taken a minute to think about it
because you have an anger problem eric
fuck you no i don't
what we need to figure out here is are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism some rage addiction it could be a lot of things
my little sunshine has a temper sometimes but he's not all bad
let's try a little experiment i wanna see maybe what kind of things trigger you eric okay how do you think you would react if i said some negative things about you
honestly i wouldn't really care
what if i were to tell you that i think you're fat i think you're a fat little boy i think you're waaaaay too fat for your age does that make you feel any anger huh fatty jellybelly you got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck you get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a yearold woman fat boy  huh you like that shittytitty jellybelly  oh yeah he's a big boy get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass big old jiggly fatty butt  huh well i just don't see it ms cartman your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all in fact i'd say he's one of the more eventempered children i've ever seen
sorry doctor your wife's on the phone says it's an emergency
excuse me  carol what whoa calm down honey what do you mean web chat with wha what yearold girl carol i would ne  no i don't have a criminal record who would who is mitch conner there can't be an official police report honey there's no no no carol put down the gun swee uh sweetie come on put down the  carol carol
i'm not fat i'm bigboned
thank you for coming parents we called you in because we've had a little incident at the school the fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway
oh dear
now we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion
did they measure from the base or from the balls
how does the school let things like this happen
now now boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing we simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done
i'm a scientist i think it's best i handle this
hello students my name is dr marsh and i'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday how do a man and a woman make a baby anybody a man and woman what do they do to make a baby how about the little girl in the brown coat yeah you
they have sex
good the man puts his penis  okay into the woman's vagina  okay now sometimes a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important but is it when you boys measure your penis length the truth is it doesn't really matter what does matter is  length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared okay when we're talking about penis size we can't just use a tape measure we need a scale  and  a protractor as well  let's look at it on the graph here  follow along with me on your study sheets kids
i want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class
we didn't make any effort we didn't have a choice
yeah this is bullshit
together we're gonna learn what makes us angry okay and how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore
so lame why doesn't everyone just die
rook ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp it's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head
we have good reason to be angry this country is going to shit we have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in america
right see what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it
man this shit wack manh i just see all this shit fummah i'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh bitch be callin me tappin that shit man
why the fuck am i here
well eric because i know you want to control your anger and become a better person
are you saying i have problems like these fucking people
no no i'm not saying that at all please i i'm just saying how a amazing you are for wanting to llessen some of your more less awesome attributes
oh that's cool
and so by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the what do we call it again the yaw the yaw of the shaft what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or tmi any questions so far yes little girl over there
what's a penis
ah good question ahh the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're measuring  okay any other questions okay so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet how about you could you read the first example for the class  example  young lady please read the problem out loud
example  randy has a penis that is  inches in length
four point four inches
its angle is  degrees its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter his balls are seven centimeters from the base
seven centimeters
randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is  kilograms
great and so divide by the  carry the  and we can see that randy's adjusted penis size or tmi is  inches do we got that randy's length is  inches but his adjusted length is  so how does our example person randy compare to others on the tmi scale by referring again to the tmi chart we see that a tmi of  is  inches more than the national average
okay what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger daniel could you stand up please  what makes you the angriest daniel
stupidass blind liberals
okay great chase could you stand up and pretend to be a stupidass blind liberal  and what makes you angriest chase
scrawnyass sissies
okay daniel's a scrawnyass sissy he just cut in front of you in line at the bank go
hey what do you think i got a small dick huh
huh i don't have a small penis my wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine
okay uh why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with wayne d who gets angriest at his mom  gretchen can you play wayne d's mom for us
yo bitch you think you bad just 'cause you're a mom don't mean i can't put a cap in your ass bitch mang
i may be female on the outside but i still have a bigger penis than you
i don't have a small penis don't say that it isn't true it isn't true
that's enough i've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize
yeah it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
does everyone here have an issue with their penis size
no
no
not me
nnnooo
no my my shit be packing manh
my penis is  inches long
hmmm
kids my name is rebecca turnod and i'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and i am here to set things straight
thank god
i want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually  length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width
vou damn n montaire
we all want to welcome our new member randy say hi to everyone randy
aw suck it all o'ya
now we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways randy why don't you share what's bothering you
you just don't go around changing math who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by obama
goddamn right socialist fascist
power to the people burn it down burn it down
mr marsh this is what we're here to try and work on okay
no dude fuck you we're burnin' this shit
if you take a minute to think about your anger and give  whoa whoawhoawhoa
yeeaahh
yeah dude
man that shit be burnin' an' shit manh
yeeaahh
yeah
yeeaahh
welcome to fedex how can i help you today
yes i've got some birthday presents i need shipped
alrighty let's see what kind of
burn it down
burn it down dude
let's see how the american government likes it when we shut down their federal express
tom i'm standing outside the fedex in fairplay colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage they call themselves the pissedoff and angry party and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago
this is a call to all angry people we've had enough we're gonna hit the government where it hurts right in the federal express
what exactly are you angry about
we're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies media control and the
the jews
yeah jews and all this stuff that the government's doing
you've got a lot of people scared what are your demands
well first of all we want that surgeon general to step down
yeeaahh
and we want
and we want to see obama's real birth certificate
yeah we want to see obama's real birth certificate and um
and my mom gotta stop trippin' manh bitch be trippin' all the time manh
yeah we want our moms to stup trippin' man 'cause the bitches be trippin' all the time and i think that uhh  is that it
no and fuck kyle
oh yeah and fuck kyle surgeon general's resignation obama's real birth certificate moms to stop trippin' and fuck kyle you got that or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt
does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government
no no that doesn't matter  fuck really
butters what are you doing
homework i just don't get it that is the fourth time i've calculated and it's below average i thought i was hung but according to my tmi i have a micropenis
your tmi
i don't understand it an' i'm startin' uhh i'm starting to feel angry rawr
butters put your clothes on
oh what's the point mom what's the point of life anyway all you do is yell at me and the government wuh which is led by fascists and everyone's a justin bieber wannabe i wanna go and drive a hummer that's what i wanna do i wanna drive a car that goes that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr
butters what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small
hey everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down america join the fight
we're gonna take down the federal expresses the american apparels and the american furniture warehouse
we're fed up and we've had enough
surgeon general twelve more fedexes have been taken over the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support
they've shut down american airlines and american apparels all over the country we have to ask you to step down
are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands
they're all really angry we have to make them stop is the team standing by to fuck that little boy kyle
team is standing by sir
'scuse me excuse me let me through
who is this
surgeon general i believe i know why this is happening i have found a direct correlation between the anger and tmi  anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw  look we all get angry but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very very very very small dick
your theory is fine doctor but it doesn't matter the tmi equation is true solid science which cannot be changed there's nothing we can do about it
isn't there isn't there
we've waited long enough randy let's start killin' these sons of bitches
no please
yeah dude they aren't gonna give us what we want
yo let's cap these bitches manh let's cap an leave em at the back of the building manh
hey come over here look
we interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general
fellow americans as you all know the tmi scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every american could accurately measure their junk the established equation is a hundred percent accurate
rrrr
shhh
however due to recently collected data we are making one change  the national average for penis length is now officially moved from  inches to  inches  anyone with a tmi of over  inches is considered above average
the winds of change are blowin'there's excitement in the aircan you feel it it's electric and magicalthe happy train's on track'cause america is backwoohoo come on
wait what
america is backamerica is back
wait according to that scale i still have a small wiener
we're back we're back we're back back backamerica is back
i'm still fucking angry
back and we're back and we're backwe're so back we're so back back back back back back
that one was smelly take this dalai terrance

because we need a jew to do the bookkeeping  dammit  kyle wait i  kyle hold on a second
i knew you were doing something terrible
what's terrible kyle we fill a little ball with crack we let the crack babies fight over it and we put it up on the internet who cares
lots of people will when i tell them
we made a thousand dollars in eleven days
you what
ask the guys there's six hospitals within a tenmile radius and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack
a thousand dollars
dude this thing is huge and it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all we're swimming in cash kyle let me take you out to denny's it's baconalia time
after you
there's a big wait to sit down
ah mr cartman we have your table waiting sir
come on
we started with two crack babies and a camera butters did all the internet stuff we've built up to a thousand hits a day
jesus christ
it's awesome
it's a good life kyle we've come here every night for denny's baconalia specials
every single night
look at the menu bacon inside pancakes bacon meatloaf they even have a bacon sundae for dessert
wow
we are turning this thing into a legitimate sport kyle we're getting slash to start playing at halftime and ea sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights
i like that boom boom powthem chicks be jackin my stylethey try and copy my swaggeri'm on that next shit nowi'm so you so  and latei got that boom boom boomthat future boom boom boomlet me get it now
you've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up kyle and best of all it's all charity so it's tax free
put your office right here kyle all of south park walking by looking up at you
and it actually helps the crack babies it's like volunteering but but we just make a little on the side
somebody's gotta eat all that bacon kyle might as well be us welcome to the firm

crack baby basketball
dude
no no it's nit's not like it sounds here check it out  see look we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack it's really getting popular  i mean it it's cool because like the commercial said the crack babies had nothing before  it it's great because everyone wins you know you see that two million hits  did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at denny's
betsy macintosh
whatta you want
we heard about you through the passages sobriety clinic they said you've skipped out on your rehab once again
oh gohhhd
we need to speak with you ma'am
it's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until i use again
and so am i correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine
i don't want my baby born addicted to drugs but i can't stop
well ma'am i have some exciting news  we would like your child to play for the crack baby athletic association
the what
we believe that st mary's is the best hospital for your child and we're prepared to offer it a full ride now do you know yet if your child is male or female or so deformed you'll never be able to tell
they said it's a boy
just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for st mary's
how much will he make
well nothing crack baby players can't make a salary based on the rules
so what you would make money off of my child that doesn't seem fair
i don't make the rules ma'am i just think them up and write them down now if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the
cain't you change the rules
rgh ma'am the crack baby athletic association is a storied franchise it was founded over twelve days ago with a firm ethical code that strictly states benefits to players is detrimentalized to their wellbeing i cannot offer you or your child any cash i can however offer you a little bit of crack butters
dude what actually makes total sense about it if you look at it is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need  yeah it's pretty cool dude because most of these babies would normally not even get out you know huh or be able to do anything  just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting it isn't exploiting them they're finding a useful place in society what's so unethical about that
you sound like cartmam
ooogh dude the thing is we're not the ones that made them crack babies that's their moms' goddamned fault
yeah i'm sure that's what cartman would say too
i do not sound like cartman goddamnit  okay so see ya
it's the easiest thing in the world how could you guys have screwed this up all i asked you to do was to get slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at cedarssinai ncu
we're just having a hard time finding him
slash is not hard to find he'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him he played at my eighth birthday party for christ's sake look look he's playing at lakewood mall right now  now you guys get down there  oh crap the president of ea sports is calling just go go  mr peters how are you yes sir we're very excited about our deal with you as well  oh we know the video game version of crack baby basketball will be a big hit too  hey kyle have a seat
i need to talk to you
mr peters can i call you back our company accountant needs me yes he is jewish okay thanks mr peters bye  how's it goin' man
in our deal with ea sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names but we aren't paying the crack babies
they can't make money it's against the rules
but this video game can make a million dollars we have to give the crack babies a piece of that
kyle it says right there rule number  crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing
gut they're the ones risking injury
what do you want me to do kyle find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules
the government could come after us cartman
we're a nonprofit company kyle
so then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an internet ad to payless shoe source go
egh to things we need to keep the office running kyle here look
a hot tub
it's not just a hot tub taste it go ahead taste it
gravy
kentucky fried chicken gravy
no way
a hot tub full of kfc gravy kyle did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime  kyle as owners of this company we owe it not only to ourselves but to the crack babies to be as stressfree and clearheaded as possible mcdonald's french fries and kfc gravy the french call this poutaine
i know but dude we can't license our games to ea sports and pay the crack babies nothing slavery is illegal
it's not illegal kyle tell you what i'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it
what other companies
dean howland a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you
a what send him in
helloo thear the name is eric p cartman i'm a wellrespected owner in the slave trade
in the what
my peaches what a wonderful office you got yourself heah certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness don't ye well let me get right down to it theyen like yourself  i am also in the slave trade  but at the moment i find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues was wonderin' if you could share some secrets
i have no idea what you're talkin' about
you have some might stronglookin' workers heah sahr i'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks
are you referring to our student athletes
student atholetes hoho that is brilliant sahr now when we sell their likeness for video games how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh student atheletes then
look there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid young man
i ain't arguin' if they got paid then how did we make all owr money right
we do  not own slaves and we have no desire to own slaves
but of course you own slaves because oh riiight  of couse you don't have desire to own slaves son neither do i and if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership gaauu  alright so now how do you get around not paying your slaves
get out this is a prestigious university and i am not saying one more word to you
you think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university  this country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves while the rest of us wallow in poverteh screw you sahr i'm goin' home
here's the thing whether or not i'm a part of it crack baby basketball is popular somebody's going to do it so the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it so that i can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies  oh it's sooo easy for you isn't it i mean what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today or what you want to watch on tv tomorrow well sorry skippy but the world isn't always black and white just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean i can't enjoy a few mcdonald's french fries in a hot tub of gravy from kentucky fried chicken
mcdonald's french fries in a hot tub of kfc gravy
it happens to be called poutine in montreal
how hard can it be clyde you walk up to slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal
we must have just missed him he was playing at cherry creek mall and then flat irons mall now we don't know where to go because slash is playing the pavilion in colorado springs in the gigadome in moscow later this afternoon
how can slash be playing in colorado springs and moscow at the same time
we don't know he's everywhere
look you morons slash clearly has a fan club right so just go to the post office and find out where the mail gets in and then you'll have slash's home address
oh that's a good idea
yeah it's a good idea now go get us slash for halftime  jesus christ  are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company kyle goddamn
alright cartman i've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the ea sports deal we're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies
what
i've designed it to be the best place for them to live a place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve and if you think it's a bad idea i really don't care
oh my god it's genius kyle
what
this the answer to our problems a three hundred thousand dollar building but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public we can say we gave our student athletes a place to live and grow for a few years it's like moral teflon i knew we needed a jew in this company kyle great work
let me get this straight you kids want me to tell you where slash lives
please sir it's very important
well i'm afraid i can't do that kids
but we have a big deal with ea sports that depends on it
come on kids write to slash every day but it all just goes into this big pile over here  the reason i can't tell you where slash lives is because he don't live nowhere don't you ever wonder how slash can be aaall those places at the same time it's because he's made up he
don't spoil it for the kids marty it's up to parents to tell their children slash ain't real
hullo
dad is slash real or makebelieve
ohh dear clyde's asking about slash
oooo well the day had to come
clyde the truth is slash isn't a person he's more like a feeling in your heart you know
slash isn't real
get out of here
clyde sometimes people like to pretend with makebelieve characters he's not really a lie he's like ahh
er he's like love people all over the world dress up like slash and have different names for slash the dutch call him vunter slash
he's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids
your mother's dutch you know clyde ha how did that old folk song go honey
vunter slash kapunshka
shpielerin manshunshka
and so thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with ea sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies did you see the blueprints the babies will have their own putt putt golf course  why does it matter how much i'm making stan if the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop why does my salary matter
you guys you guuys we've got some bad news slash isn't real
what
slash isn't real he's a madeup person that represents care and giving and people dress up like him and lie to their kids
slash is makebelieve
here look for yourself  he's based on the fable of a dutch saint named vunter slash
vunter slash
what
but then who played at my eighth birthday party
one of our parents
but then who was the guitar player for guns n' roses
one of our parents
are you fucking serious
you guys are ten years old and you just figured out that slash isn't real oh my god
you knew about this
my parents told me slash wasn't real when i was five jehesus christ
well what the heck do we do now
look let's just get our money from ea sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all
boys i want to thank you for bringin' the cb double a franchise here to ea sports you've made us a lohhht of monih
wait a minute according to this you now own all the rights to crack baby basketball and we got nothing
yes our lawyers are damn good but you didn't get nothin' why you boys got experience didn'tcha you got a chance to play in the big leagues sure we here at ea might have made all the monih but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves i'd give you some free video games but it's against the rules
you can't do this we were gonna build an orphanage so the crack babies have somewhere to go
oh well fuck 'em and fuck you too i piss in your faces
i just can't believe slash isn't real
i know it's messin' with my head so hard
you guys we've just been screwed over and lied to
i know right i was always extra good before my birthday too because i was told slash would come and play for me
well boys this has been real educational and all but now let's part with that old ea sports sayin' get the fuck out of my buildin'
it's unbelievable stan ea sports just used us the entire time we worked for nothing and ea made all the money you know i don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but but i guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems i know i know right we might've got screwed but the really tragic thing is that those those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there with nowhere to go  no way  this is it
it's what
this is it stan  it's just like i designed it there's the miniature gold course over there and slides and uh  excuse me what is this place
isn't it wonderful all the crack babies will have a home now
but who paid for all this
kyle kyle look
you don't think that but he isn't real
maybe or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all
vunter slash kapunshka shpielerin manshunshka het mine gaset rosa danka vunter slasha
he is real you guys
vunter slash kapunshka shpielerin manshunshka het mine gaset rosa

oh cool is this the new gersploosh album
yeah dude
uh hold it is that a tween wave band
yeah they're the best
sorry stan you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff
mom i'm  years old now
i've told you what i think of this music stanley you have plenty of other gifts to enjoy
looks like somebody's on the rag huh mom
sharon stan told me you took away his music cd at his birthday party
oh for crying out loud i gave him a great party and that's all he cares about
well do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to
yes i do if it's that stupid tween wave garbage
tween wave
you haven't heard it it's terrible it's hardly even music it just sounds like crap
sharon come on don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap
this is different
so here we are now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit
it's not because i'm older i'm telling you our music is better
back in my day our music was better not this garbage the young 'un listen to warber warber warber
fine randy  you go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap
i'd love to i'm not an old fuddyduddy sharon i'm still cool
well it sounds like crap right
uh no i mean  i like it
oh come on that music sounds like shit
no it's just young and hip so you don't get it sharon
admit it randy you think it sounds like crap too
it doesn't sound like crap at all i think it's awesome
it's called tween wave and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it a new music genre for the era from  through  or the tweens every generation has their music but many parents say tween wave sounds like crap
it's just vulgar and stupid you know music used to be good
this sounds like poo
i certainly don't understand kids' music today sounds like diarrhea to me
kids however say they don't hear crap at all
parents are dumb
they don't get it
they don't get it parents are stupid
tween wave is swick
tweem wave is super swick and parents don't get it 'cause their ears are old
parents are dumb
we're sorry boys but we have all decided that as of now none of you are allowed to listen to tween wave music
ugh that's so unfair
but that's our music we like it
yeah it's good
what's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat
we don't know what you're talking about it doesn't sound that way to us
yeah it it doesn't sound like that to us
i wanna educate you kids with some real music  this is the police now you compare this to tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music
yuck
what
that sounds like shit
whattaya mean it sounds like shit this doesn't sound like shit
gross
turn it off dude
stanley i want you to understand that even though i won't let you listen to certain kinds of music i still love you
i know mom i love you too
soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices but for now i just don't want you listening to that stuff
it's okay mom i understand
that's very mature of you stanley goodnight sweetie
'night  haha  ugh  what the hell
oh dude dude this is the part i was talking about check out the bassline on this
oh yeah that one's cool  yeah this part's killer
hey stan
hey dudes
dude have you really listened to the sixth track i think it's my new favorite
yeah yeah i've listened to it um kyle can i talk to you alone for a second
sure  what's up
kyle i have to admit something to you you know how i told you over the phone i like the new gersploosh album i lied i don't like it i don't like it at all kyle
oh really um well that's okay
no you don't understand dude something's happened tween wave doesn't sound the same to me
why what's it sound like
it kind of sounds like shit
what you mean like you don't like the singing or the lyrics or what
no i mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears please just listen really close  you don't hear shit
no
that doesn't sound like shit to you
no dude maybe you should see a doctor
and so then i put on exactly the same album that i really like a year ago and it sounded like shit to me
uh huh and what about food are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now too
yeah i used to love these pop rock things and i tried them the other day and i thought they tasted like shit
this says you had a birthday recently
i just turned
well that makes sense you see stan as you get older your eardrums taste buds all that stuff develops and changes
so this is normal

big harry and mike in the morning we'll talk more about it but let's get to some music the new tween wave band  with their song
coming this fall to foxcbsfx jurassic park and lost in the same tv show   dinosaurs  lost humans  future yes
stanley eat your waffles
oh shut up cartman you don't even know what you're talking about
oh yeah i saw it on the news kyle the school is gonna make us all get shots again  but this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas
are you serious
yep
that's only a vaccination for girls stupid
then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded
because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or asperger's
wait what
that's what they're talking about on the news
wait there's a disease called assburgers
yes
you are so lying there's no disease called fuckin' assburgers
you wanna bet  let's go ask my dad right now
okay you're on jew
and so children at noon today all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations and boys will head on out to recess
do the girls get their shots right in the vagina
no butters that's not how it works
mr garrison  these three boys were caught playing hooky
did you guys know there's actually a disease called assburgers
sit down boys we'll talk about this later right now we're talking about vaginal warts
this isn't fair how can the school make us get vaccinated
you mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole
that's right it's a butt fungus
well i don't want burgers comin' out of my butt
god shut up everyone just shut the fuck up
m'kay stan you you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this m'kay i know that your parents recently got divorced m'kay that's gotta be hard i know that's that's bad but when you walk around all mopey m'kay and sayin' everything is just shitty well that's called bein' a debbie downer stan and nobody likes a debbie downer m'kay i mean you've gotta you've gotta snap out of it debbie come on debbie you're even bummin' me out now m'kay your attitude just just sucks
i just want everything to go back to the way it was
okay well that's not gonna happen debbie okay you know uh life life has to change m'kay
how when all the things that made you laugh just make you sick how do you go on when nothing makes you happy
huh eexcuse me a minute stan m'kay  uh hi ms bronski did we vaccinate stan for the flu last year we did uh oh i think he's got asperger's
this is breaking news from cnn or fox or whatever  fuck you
the first documented case of a child developing asperger's syndrome from school vaccinations  has put the government in a tight spot  at a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father steamy ray vaughn
it's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent and then the government comes along and with one shot turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak i mean look at him he's disinterested depressed selfloathing it's most likely the reason his mother and i got divorced
in response to the embarrassment the president of the united states has passed stan's bill putting an end to schoolmandated vaccinations
mr president the bill is ready
just sign right here mr president
aaand if you could just sign this one as well mr president
it is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations but if so multimilliondollar lawsuits are probably not far behind
turn on your heart light let it shine wherever you go let it make a happy glow
eric what is it this time
fever light lightheadedness i don't know what's wrong with me
you don't feel warm
oh that's a relief i thought maybe i had a fever but i oh oh oh my buns there's a sharp pain in my buns

ii'll try i'll try
what the  what is this a hamburger
a what
why are there hamburgers in your underwear
are you serious how can there be  oh my god you're saying i have assburgers
this doesn't make sense are you trying to sneak food into the school or something
what are you talking about i got vaccinated from the school and now clearly i have assburgers
very funny
well i'm glad you think assburgers is funny just note my condition on your records there
get out of my office
hey kyle  have you heard anything at all from stan
i've tried wendy i've called him i've been to his house but since his diagnosis all he's done is gotten worse
i don't know what to do it's like he's completely turned off
those two should just screw and get it over with
yeaahh
i can't keep doing it wendy i know he has an illness but goddamn it uh it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything
look maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together anand that way we could
no i can't wendy  all his negativity is starting to make me depressed i have to let him go  and whatever happens next i'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude
godamned stupid school nurse heartless bitch
what's the matter dude
i spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing that's what's the matter
you made hamburgers well that's awesome i'd love one  mmm hm wow  this is really good cartman
really
yeah  hey riley try this hamburger  cartman made them himself
wow what is that
seriously cartman you could make money with these
gee thanks kyle
the truth is we still know very little about asperger's syndrome mrs marsh all our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits  good morning mr mathers
goodbye doctor
it's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not  we've got a new patient martin i want you to meet stan
nice to meet you
here at the treatment center our focus is on awareness  asperger's is serious but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of  alright everyone let's have a seat  oh uh we'll be done at about  pm mrs marsh i'll call if it's any earlier
oh right uh good bye stan ii love you
alright are we clear
we're clear
watch that window puck  everyone make sure this room isn't bugged  alright stan listen up we don't have a lot of time you've been told asperger's is real it isn't it's just a front we use to stay hidden
wait it's not a real illness
of course not if there was a social development disease you wouldn't call it asperger's that's just that's just mean  there's a big war going on out there stan and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down
uh nooo nonono we're not doing this
you've broken through their reality and they don't like it others deserve to know the truth you see everything as shit don't you  where other people see fun movies and hear cool music all you see and hear is shit am i right
yeah
so do we all of us here we know the truth too
we found a way to make it stop stan now are you interested or not

who are you people
we are the secret society of cynics  everything looks like shit to you right what if i were to tell you that you're seeing the world the way it actually is
huh
the world around us has all completely turned to shit but aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
aliens
or robots from the future whatever the point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance
yeah everything used to be awesome and cool but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us
yeah
because of aliens
or genetically altered humans whatever fuck you all that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down they know who we are but they won't be expecting you are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in
yeah i'm ready

big harry and mike in the morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of  we're breakin' it down

nonono no how about when
he's back  did you see the illusionary world again
how does it feel to be back in the matrix

he's gonna pop
come on kid there's not a lot of time left
you're pushin' him too hard
ugh god
stan you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion we're sending you back in
we all know why we are here there's a rebellion in our midst and it must be squashed out  we have to put an end to cartman burgers
yes yes but what do we do
at kfc we've seen a  drop in sales
it's worse at pizza hut cartman burgers choked out the market
what makes them so good for whatever reason these cartman burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants
there lies the secret  it's the chemical compounds from all our flavors pizza hut burger king kfc all somehow infused into one burger
it's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food breaking them down into some kind of gas and them somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger what kind of instrument could he be using to do this
it would have to be some sort of super dutch oven
but a dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen
aughah
hey wake up come on now wake up  use the smelling salts
enchirito
you know the secret
what you guys are aliens
stop playing with us what's the secret behind cartman burger's amazing taste
dude i don't know
he's lying  you see this kid in the picture this guy is his best friend
ah ha
i'm not friends with him
they've been through everything together inseparable
no no we don't hang out anymore
oho right like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that
dude i didn't walk away i turned  and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me so i
oh sure anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good now stop playing games and tell us why cartman burgers is so delicious
i don't know
alright i guess we're going to have to do this the hard way
there ten mediums and five mediumrares
alright i'll take these to the flavor enhancer
next please  oh hey
kyle you've gotta tell me the secret to cartman burger
what are you doing
how do you guys make them so yummy
i don't know
you'd better get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head  you got that
dude just tell me the secret to cartman burger
why so that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times
no because there's aliens with a sniperchicken on me
oh god look i know you got asperger's from the school and i i'm sorry but your negativity is poison to me
oh right like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness
dude i'm sorry that i've been bumming you out but it's not my fault
you said fuck you to my face stan
dude i didn't realize what i was saying

i don't want everything to go back to the way it was  i i don't  you were right kyle sometimes the only way to go forward is to take a big left turn i've been resisting it but i'm ready now i want you to stay with cartman burger dude it's okay you're gonna do this and i'm gonna do my thing and my mom and dad aren't getting back together but you know what it's okay in fact it's better change is gonna bring new things to all of us where will cartman burger go from here that'll be cool to see and it opens me up to a whole new adventure exploring new relationships with all new people in town  maybe this kid will become my new best friend  or maybe this kid will

uhh sir aren't those mexicans runnin' into mexico
that don't make sense
you're goin' the wrong way
you've heard of mexican salsa but mexican pride the phenomenon is called orgullo de mantequilla where mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the us the borders are being flooded with latin americans trying to get back to their own countries
well i think it's good  if the mexican people feel inspired good for them people have a right to go and be happy  noooooo
but just what has sparked the mexican desire to live in mexico joining us now is economist mark geiger and mark we've heard of mexican ice cream but mexican patriotism
yes it's a very odd phenomenon chris ih it just
cartman what the hell is this
you guys the game is over clearly i won give it up

the standardissue border patrol weapon is the p stun baton it carries a  watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law

a baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar
you guys oh my god you guys  you're never gonna guess what  seriously you guys guess what
what
you guys you know pete melman  fourth grade mr bart's class
the blond kid
yeah yeah pete melman
what about him
he crapped his pants today during social studies he had to go to the nurse's office and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans
how do you know
because dude it's all over eavesdropper
eavesdropper
what's that
puhah you guys don't follow eavesdropper   it's a web site about all the students in the school
hey did you guys see eavesdropper pete melman shit his pants
yeah yeah i'm showin' the guys  check it out eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to pete melman's mom  just listen listen listen
hello mrs melman this is the school nurse i'm afraid your son has had a little accident
oh no what is it is he okay
turn it up
no no it's not serious but he went number two during class  i'm afraid he's gonna need a new pair of pants and underwear and a clean pair of socks
hey did you guys see eavesdropper
yeah yeah we're listenin' to it
dude that's so wrong
hey pete melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies
okay okay so what do we call pete melman when we see him i was thinking poopypants pete but th but then i also thought of mushpants melman
attention south park students will the following students report to the principal's office immediately eric cartman thank you
oh jesus what now
eric as you might have heard a student here in south park elementary had an accident in the classroom
puhi know dude pete melman crapped his pants so freakin' funny
oookay but you probably understand that for pete it isn't that funny for him it's embarrassing and terrifying
tchehe right that's why it's super funny to me
eric it has been almost one year since corey duran defecated in his pants here in school now you remember what happened to him
yeah he killed himself
yes and the reason he killed himself eric was that the ridicule and the torment from other students  spearheaded by you cause him
hey whoooa
spearheaded by you m'kay made him feel there was no other way out
'kay whoa whoa we've been through this you cannot put corey duran's death on me i'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone
eric we are asking you to please just remember what happened to corey and not let it happen to pete
please just let it go
you're asking me to simply ignore a kid who  excuse my language but i have to be harsh here  a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone  to just ignore that so he can have a normal life
we are hoping that if you don't fan the flames eric the other students might forget might forget about it
do you really think information like this will just die down there's internet there's eavesdropper you might be worried pete melman is gonna kill himself but the truth is he was dead the second he crapped his pants
alright eric here's the deal this school cannot have another suicide on its hands we want you to see pete melman through this and turn public opinion around
heh you're crazy it can't be done
if pete melman does not kill himself  we will make it very worth your while
you aren't listing to anythin  make it worth my while how
no way
what's up
thehay've got a video of pete melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on eavesdropper
dude that's fucked up
come on dude it's pretty funny
it's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a web site for everyone to see
yeah dude that's pretty funny
it's megasuperhilarious
uh hey jenny sup
what do you want
did you hear about pete melman pretty messed up huh
yeah it's gross
so whatcha doin' for lunch eh my mom packed me the best stuff she even baked cupcakes
so what
i was just thinkin' that mmmaybe we could eat lunch together i've always kind of  liked you
i don't like you
i know ah i know you don't like me back i ju yeah you know the this was stupid i'm sorry will you just take a cupcake  oh don't take the cupc i i'm sorry i i'm sorry i wasted your time
hey wait  look i'm sorry that was mean i'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes
and now number  many of you got wrong as well the correct answer was d whales are mammals
oh gahhh ohf
they're not fish like some of you retards chose
you okay jenny
yeah i'm fine i just awwgh  mmr garrison can i please  be excused
excused oh oh but we are in the middle of class
what's the matter
gah i just need to go to the restroom
well okay
ah mr garrison i don't think that's quite fair uh i mean you rarely let us get up and leave during the class
please i've gotta go now
well just give it a couple of minutes jenny it could just be a cramp
no mr garrison i've gotta go aaah
eeeeww
oh my god jenny simons crapped her pants  did you hear that  it's way worse than pete melman was
ew
sick
way worse
run
the doctors say that jenny simon barely survived the fall jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis
alright kewl
no not cool m'kay she's on suicide watch eric she's given up on life
you said pete melman couldn't kill himself by making jenny simon crap her pants worse than pete i've made her the number one story on eavesdropper
that's wasn't the point eric nobody was supposed to kill themselves unless you fix this our deal is off
mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants and nobody can die
yes
jesus christ  okay okay  um jesus  ah okay look  okay those those tests we took last week the state efficiency tests how did we do on those
our students did average maybe just below average
okay no they all did awesome in fact our students did so good on the tests that you  you decided to reward them all at lunch you're serving the students pizza from pizza hut but we're going to put laxatives and arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess everyone craps their pants nobody's singled out problem solved
that's insane
okay well if you have a better idea then why am i here
uh hi jan it's counselor mackey uh how long would it take to organize a pizza friday for the students yeah yeah no they uh they actually did really well on the state exam yeah mkay
dude check it out eavesdropper found an email from jenny simon's boyfriend calling her softserve simon
that's not funny
hey here's a post about token token black's private gym photos
i'm not looking at that
come on dude it's pretty funny
it wouldn't be funny if that web site posted something about you
i wouldn't care
exclusive stan marsh thinks elise thompson has a hot butt crack
what
in an email sent yesterday to kenny mccormick stan marsh wrote 'dude you should have been in pe today elise thompson's butt crack was totally showing' he went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'
kenny kenny what the fuck
what
how did eavesdropper get a hold of my email to you
i don't know
do you just leave your emails open for everyone to read
no
that was a private email from me to you  hey wendy
you like looking at girls' butt cracks stan
oh fuck i'm gettin' out of here
no i was telling kenny he would like it
do you have any idea how embarrassed i am
wendy it was just a quick email to kenny new stories pop up on eavesdropper every hour people are gonna forget all about this
so you didn't email anybody else about elise thompson's butt crack right
this is an issue of trust and privacy we have to all work together to put an end to eavesdropper once and for all  yes kyle
so just to be completely clear now it isn't funny right
ugh what's funny about having our private lives hacked into
specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack
shut up butters what we have to find out is who in the school is running eavesdropper i've done an extensive profile and i've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room  now whoever you are you're a gossiping little bitch  and we're not gonna
it's not somebody in this room
what how do you know
because whoever it is just now posted a new story on eavesdropper allison taft reveals embarrassing secret about craig tucker  yeah hey wait that's me
where is it coming from
huh
if it's on the school network we can track the ip address  this way in here  whoever it is using the computer in the music room
we only have music class on thursday
of course a kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know
get ready guys whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our emails and phone calls you guys ready
oh i'm ready
one  two three
it's a rat
get it
don't let him get away
he's gone
what the hell a stupid rat is in charge of eavesdropper
wikileaks  it says here his name is wikileaks
lemmiwinks i come with news of great gravity another rodent is out there spreading terrible rumors and hacking emails  yes and i'm afraid the news is worse the creature doing this lemmiwinks is your brother wikileaks
''wikileaks the bum hacker with a heart of doomeveryone knows the gerbil king but no one ever speaksof lemminwinks's brother the evil likiweaks
once again wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world only you can stop him lemmiweaks
lemmiwinks king of gerbils stop your brother of doom
it's just so embarrassing what if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab
it's okay emily can i tell you a secret my mom has a drinking problem too
really you too
that's just between us okay
of course tammy i'm really glad i shared this with you
stop that rat
knock it off
i just want you to know that i have a hure crush on you and  hey
no wikileaks bad
yup a few more laxatives on that one a little more arby's horsey sauce on there mhm
eh is this one good
yeah i think they're all ready
you sure this will work eric what if some of the students don't eat the pizza
it doesn't matter enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about pete melman and jenny simons forever
alright eric well well get back to class we don't want anyone seeing you in here with us
uh hold on just a second i believe we discussed the little matter of my payment  i'm not letting you guys screw me over again give me what i wanted now
alright fine bring her in adler
oh my god selena gomez you  you actually got her to come
hi eric i understand you really wanted to meet me wanna get a picture together
no thanks okay proceed
im sorry about this ms gomez  alright get her the fuck out of here
okay eric you got what you wanted are we straight
that was amazing
alright now get back to class adler get rid of those laxative bottles trash all the arby's horsey sauce packages too there cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here  what the  oh shit  stop that rat
alright lemmiwinks we should probably get going now the time is nigh lemmiwinks let us chase your destiny  ah sparrow prince what news do you bring
wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment  the birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet
then the moment is truly here come lemmiwinks let us make haste lelelemmiwinks his heart is so heavy i weep for him
indeed could you do it frog prince could you kill your own brother
i thank god i don't have to make that decision  we might need to bring in some outside help
you see there look it says eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon
biggest story about who
there's no telling it could be about any of us
well met children of adam i am catatafish
catatafish of the salmon school
what
i come asking for your help there is only one thing that can stop wikileaks but right now lemmiwinks is being held prisoner
lemmiwinks our old class gerbil
what is that thing
i am catatafish i am a great wizard and i am a friend and i'm a ghost besides of course being a fish
catatafish's tale will soon be told
do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the internet
he does it purely for reasons of evil and his treachery is not limited to humans wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me too he posted on his web site that i had sex with an underage fish and that i made her perform bass to mouth if you accept this quest you will help the gerbil king defeat wikileaks once and for all but the choice is yours i'm not here to make you do anything like that underage salmon i didn't make her do anything if she wants to do bass to mouth how is it my fault
catatafish made a salmon suck asshole
no no see that's wrong it's being exaggerated again
just tell us where lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat
careful child i assure you wikileaks is anything but stupid except when he said i made that teenage fish perform ass to trout that was stupid and untrue did i say ass to trout i meant to say bass to mouth though i guess it's basically the same thing not that i did it
alright are we sure we're alone
we're alone now what the hell are we gonna do
what can we do we're all gonna get fired
this story hasn't gone up on eavesdropper yet maybe it won't
oh right the school faculty tries to poison all their students that's not gonna be on wikileaks
oh let's just face it we made our beds when we enlisted eric cartman's help we have to lie in them
all we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves we're not bad
no no we're not bad
we're not bad i mean maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here i mean if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story
what's a bigger story than all the students being made sick
our students committing suicide
hey that's right corey duran killed himself last year and we're still dealing with the fallout maybe there is a way out of this but we're gonna have to throw eric cartman under the bus
how do we do that
we get a bus and then we throw eric cartman under it
yes
hi does a vernon trumski live here
yes vernon's around somewhere
come on guys
excuse me
there he is  it's lemmiwinks

enjoying the show
oh yeah it's not really what i expected
no
to be honest i'm just here for the blowjob from what i heard i figured the show must be really sexy and hot but i just don't see it happening
oh it'll happen don't worry right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages all she'll be thinking about afterwards is blowjob
subliminal messages
it's a musical thing women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds broadway writers call it subtext just listen really really closely
while you'll do great here in the emerald city i'm sure you can't wait to go
take me away to that special place that blowjob placewhere people like us can all live free free to give blowjobstake me away and let's live togetherthat's the placeblowjobs for you blowjobs and me

and new loves cry  defying  gravity
suddenly  don't you love free love blowjobs
oho that was so much fun all the costumes and the sets were amazing i really love the songs that stephen schwartz is a genius i've got them all stuck in my head  hey that was such a treat how would you like a little treat
whoa no way
come on larry  dude why does this happen every time
do something you stupid vegan
coach feegan the vegan won't jump off the board hey coach
you just don't get it stotch i'm telling you go see wicked it's the best time
how long was it
she started in the car and then it lasted the whole drive home and then she kept going for like another twenty minutes
nice bro
get tickets stotch it's worth it
what was the show about
uh shit i don't know some green chick and a goat or something
come on feegan either jump or get off

look i thought broadway musicals weren't for me either but i just didn't know about the whole subtext thing you know i couldn't really appreciate 'em till now
wicked isn't even the best bro you've gotta check out jersey boys it makes women hummer crazy
really
nonono have you see south pacific that's a jawbreaker
say sharon how would you like to go to new york for the weekend
what randy are you serious
i got plane tickets and a hotel room we leave in three hours
oh my god first you take me to wicked and now this
hey wait dad are you guys really going away what about us
oh don't worry i've taken care of everything you're staying the weekend with the feegans
not the vegans
no dad please don't do this
it takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world you get labeled soft or silly  but the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan
yes
cancer heart disease drowning all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket and if people wanna say us vegans are silly well they can just laugh all they want 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular
maybe you should let your son decide that for himself
he does decide for himself larry's been a vegan since he was born
maybe if larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school
you know that when you think you have the flu you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs researchers have found that in meateating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets

sit down mr marsh we need to have a talk
we got wind of your musical just what the hell do you think you're doing
same as you guys trying to get men lengthier betterquality blowjobs
you're making it too obvious women are gonna figure out what we're doin'
musicals are about subtext
my musical has lots of subtext
a blowjob isn't with your mouth it's with your heart now get on your knees and put that heart to work
and then she does it's a metaphor

sorry folks we are in a hold we are in a hold

the musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater  the only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time the fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver
shelly i'm sorry your little friend was killed by spiderman tonight just know that for spiderman to do what he did he must have had a very good reason spiderman works in mysterious ways shelly and wherever he is he loves you
it's just so wrong for men to m manipulate women like that i don't care how much singing and dancing there is a woman's mouth is sacred tomorrow i am calling woman's day magazine and exposing the whole conspiracy  i'm sorry sharon i love you  i shouldn't have tried to brainwash you you have every right to be mad
i don't know if i can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in america does
really
oh randy  the bottom line is i love going to those shows if the fallout from that is i make you really happy for a while well i guess they're actually a pretty magical thing
oh sharon you're the best
so what broadway show do you think is coming to denver next
i don't know but whatever it is it's worth the ticket price because couples that pay to see it are stronger better and much much happier
the book of mormon you'll get a blowjob
last week the students of this school participated in the presidential fitness test i'm sad to announce that south park elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country  on the whole you students actually scored fine but the president's fitness test is scored on a schoolwide average and one fourth grader at this school scored so low with a terrifying body fat score  and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventyyearold man that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country  however the presidential fitness program never wants to single out one child because then that child might feel bad and so as far as we're concerned you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs
ah could you please use a little different terminology
sorry as far as the board is concerned you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs and so it is the recommendation of this board that every week each class will alternate turns giving up their recesses and instead reporting to pe
awww
alright fourth grade class you're up first we're gonna do some ropeclimbin'
god this sucks
four weeks we gotta do this
well let's just suck it up guys all we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it
alright mccormick let's start with you climb the rope
heheh look at kenny he's so poor huh you guys his family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit
alright let's go broflovski
heheheheheh look you guys a jew on a rope you know what they call a jew on a rope
alright cartman stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you
hey whoa we are here because the average score was low that's about all of us
because of you it's your fault that we have to do this we have to do this because you're unhealthy
yeah we're paying for your being fat
wow craig i can't believe you just went there here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about kenny being poor and kyle being a jew and you just decided to go  and bust out the fat quip
we are here because of you eric so just keep your mouth shut
oh my god why doesn't everyone just back off i know how this works you're the  ganging up on the
oh grow up
jesus christ the  is totally ganging up on me
that's what we mean by grow up dude stop being a baby
yeah why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again
ngh and then and then wendy said that they were the  and i was the  and that made me not keeeewl
but eric you are cool
i know clyde frog but now the  is saying everything is my faaault
it's not your fault eric how can they blame you for what is clearly president obama's fault
what do you mean peter panda
you didn't make that stupid presidential fitness test obama did
yeah that's right eric you don't need to grow up you are awesome and keeewl
thanks polly prissypants i'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back
ehe and so then skeletor told terminator he wanted a divorce and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon
dude butters how many times do we have to go over this that's not skeletor that's a woman named maria shriver
uh but then why does his face look like that
what what what what are you guys talking about what are you guys doin'what are you talking about i knew it you guys are having a big  rally aren't you occupying the cafeteria you wanna know why you guys are all here protesting because you're pissed off but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president so you're all just pissed off at me well go ahead have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the  see what it gets you
hey you know eric is right maybe we should form a  club
yeah it's not a bad idea if all the students unite we can work together to fight the fffit
yeah the fifth graders agree we're all being punished for one lazy bitch let's make him suffer
all we need is some good oldfashioned di di di diplomacy
hello sir we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at south park elementary
aahh yes the fatty boombalatty class how's the extra pe treating you
sir we believe your fitness system is flawed and that for  of us it is unfair
what do you want me to do about it
well sir we believe that the  should be dropped from the fitness results so that our scores can be more accurate
'fraid that's impossible the national fitness test has very specific standards no one child can ever be made to feel singled out we don't even like to use the term physically fit anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard
excuse me can you use a different terminology please
aand then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard
sir all of the students already know who the  is
all you're doing is making the other  more angry i warn you this could turn very ugly
mom have you been here all day
no sweetie i've been at the hair salon why
somebody's been in my room  fucking ers what did they take
are you sure sweetie
am i sure look at this place
but who would want to s
don't you get it mom people voted for obama so now that everything sucks they have to blame me  they didn't take my stormtrooper watch  my arkham city game is still here what else could they have   oh my god  clyde frog
what
no  nooo  clyde frog  they took clyde frog
clyde frog clyde clyde frog  clyde clyde frog
i've known clyde frog since i was two years old he was a fighter a visionary but most of all clyde frog was the perfect friend he never said anything he never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do he just sat there goin' along with whatever i wanted a noble trait that seems lost on you ers  and now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer well whoever you are i'm sure you're sitting there right now in your little green hat with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking i'm not getting away with this am i because whoever you are maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left covered up and tainted black by years of jewish propaganda and leftwing lies maybe you should just
shut the hell up cartman
got something to say kyle
how do you murder a stuffed animal
how do you murder a stuffed animal you tell us kyle  butbut but but but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves there's still a biiig investigation to come and until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was you are all just as guilty as kyle thank you so much bagpipes please

oh my jesus oh not a  rally
i sure hope this works
tom i'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up and have decided to occupy red robin occupy red robin has been going on for several hours now and boys technically i am part of the  so what do i have to say about all this
thank you all so much for coming i realize that clyde frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me
why would somebody do such a terrible thing
why would somebody hurt clyde frog eric especially because you are so awesome and keewl
i know that i'm awesome and keewl polly prissypants but it has little relevance at the moment to clyde frog's murder
let's stop the charades eric and let's get down to business
what do you mean rumpertumskin
we all know who fuckin' killed clyde frog and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives
eric sweetie is everything okay
does everything look okay
sit down you fucking bitch
yes sit down mother we are all having a tea party
uh sweetie i see that you're a little disturbed right now but maybe you can
shut your fat piehole bitch
yeah you know what you did skank you let clyde frog get murdered
no rumpertumskin i didn't i swear
then why did you write in your diary it was probably time for eric to grow out of his stuffed animals anyway
that's an excellent point muscleman marc please continue
well all i'm saying eric is that
sweetie you really can just talk to me if you
all i'm saying eric is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason
eric i promise you i didn't do anything to your favorite toy whoever did this to you i hate them as much as you do and i'd do anything to get to the bottom of it
so then we are all going to need some more tea
you'd better give me every cop you've got on the south side i don't care where abc parks their truck as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks  jesus this protest is getting out of hand alright what exactly are we dealing with
it's no good the protest has quadrupled in size since this morning as you can see from this aerial photograph the protest covers almost two square miles we have right officers here here and here the media has been contained in this area
and where are the actual protesters
oh these two people right here
how are we gonna contain this ting
i'm afraid it's about to get worse you see this area here this is where we're setting up the stage for bon jovi
bon jovi
these are good cops we can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment the problem is with this area blocked by napping tents we have no place to serve the officers beer
damnit don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards  fullon class warfare
what the hell  mom mom my room is  aaah peter panda
the fire started with this definitely a case of arson somebody hates this kid
don't you touch him leave him alone  peter panda
eh eric
don't try to talk peter panda you're gonna be okay
eric remember  stay keeewl
sorry kid we need to take this as evidence
noohoho peter panda nooo
the ers movement continues to grow as more and more americans occupy red robin i asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish  and sir what do you hope to accomplish by this movement
i like the uh a peppercorn burger and they got ummm bobottomless fries
and as the protesters inside red robin unite together word is that filmmaker michael moore has joined the protesters outside
i look at the faces of you protesters and i see the future of america we are the  yesss
hey dude ah are you the guys messing with cartman's stuffed animals
maybe we are and maybe we aren't you got any proof
well just you and your friends were the ones saying cartman needs to suffer
that doesn't prove anything that fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him
yeah but dude he seriously could have died in that fire
he's in your class but you don't deal with him so we are gonna remedy the situation we've got big plans just stay out of our way and let the men handle this
thank you so much for allowing eric and i to stay here
of course you can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage
to be honest we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us we never knew your son and our son were so close
i asked little eric where he would feel safest and he said with his friend token
this window locks from the inside right and this door has a lock on it too don't worry polly prissypants you're gonna be safe here in this day and age black people are just impervious to being fucked with so we will be alright
why are you involving me in this
token please you're the only person i can trust because in today's time black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong
breaking news from the occupy red robin movement the protesters have decreased in number from two to one as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement occupy the restroom
tom occupy the restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever these ers are fed up  and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is occupied  uh tom it looks like the movement is finished but from the time it took it must have been a pretty decentsized movement
will you stop changing channels and just pick something
what do you wanna watch polly prissypants
this is my room i'll take the remote from you
muh uh 'cause i'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home
you're a guest here your mom isn't in charge
naw uh 'cause my house got burned down so everyone has to feel bad for me  what is that what is that
that's the alarm someone's in the back yard
what who
i don't know
i thought i was safe here stay there guys i'll be right back
who's there  lock that door behind you token  black people live here
a motion detector
aha i knew it was you kyle
it's not me i'm here to help you fatass
oh sure
stop it cartman it's true we came to keep an eye out stephen tamil said he had something big planned
stephen tamil the fifth grader  oh shit  i told you to lock that door token  no  nononono  where are they kenny
i don't really know
haaaagh
hey cartman what the hell are you doing
i don't trust any of you assholes  where are you sons of bitches

here we go
hey what are you fifth graders doing
we are the  we are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class the fourth grade is stickin' it to the other  of the school
now hold on a second fellas if you're the  then our class is only
yeah how can the  be sticking it to the
because your class had cartman in it and he's the
but if he's  of  then he's
this is it the inevitable has happened at occupy red robin it is fullon class warfare
and now class warfare is breaking out apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class
it's here the class warfare is finally here
yeeah
hello  whoever you are just give them back haven't you done enough to me
muscleman marc aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa
polly prissypants rumpertumskin  jesus christ
eric don't come any closer
who did this to you
you said you wouldn't let anything happen to us
don't worry i'll get you down
no eric don't come any
aaaahaa aahaaaa rumpertumskin rumper  rumpertumskin why why did you do this
it's okay eric it's over now
polly polly prissypants you did this
don't you see the kids at school were right eric it was time for us to grow up
you got rid of clyde frog you burned peter panda
yes they're gone and now we can grow up and be together
they were your friends
they were holding us back all the kids making fun of you at school saying you're not keewl your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of don't you see
deadbolted token  token you in there
polly prissypants when people find out we did all this we're gonna get in total trouble
no i thought of everything it all happened here so that everyone would think token did it all the blame will be on him and we can live happily ever after
there's one problem  you say i have to grow up to get rid of all my dolls you forget one crucial thing polly prissypants that nobody would possibly blame token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything
oh no you're totally right but i thought my plan was perfect i failed i failed you you have to kill me eric so that you don't get blamed
noho i've lost every stuffed animal i won't lose you too
it's the only way eric you have to do it please i can't live with myself after what i've done please you have to do it eric
goodbye polly prissypants i love you
say hello to the sunrise for me
dude what the hell
we told him to grow up so he got rid of his stuffed animals
my little eric can sometimes be a bit dramatic
occupy red robin is over class warfare has torn apart the  and replaced it with the  the  and even little brackets of s here and there what does this mean for our country what oes this mean for me
hey get down to state street they're occupying macaroni grill
oh hell yeah i'll occupy me some goatcheese peppadew peppers
okay children let's all take our seats  as you all know thanksgiving is only two weeks away and so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live native american
oh neato huh fellas
hello boys and girls my name is david running horse sawitsky and i am one sixteenth cherokee indian
does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you
there've been a lot of stories about the first thanksgiving and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the pilgrims look good and my people being degraded as usual was thanksgiving about turkey and peace or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race
thanksgiving is about murder
this is bullcrap a guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on thanksgiving
well it is kinda true you know thanksgiving is fun and all but the native americans got pretty screwed over
yeah and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them
hey fatass instead of laying in bed eating why don't you come and help
jesus kyle you are really being crampy today
we all have to do this report together dude
you guys we are wasting time if we have to write a report on thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch tv
how is that gonna help
dumbass it's november  the history channel is probably playing thanksgiving specials back to back we can learn everything we need
you're watching the history channel where the truth is history
a lot has been written about the first thanksgiving between pilgrims and native americans but what really happened at that first historic dinner
dude see i told you who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got history channel
we know the first thanksgiving was in the fall of  but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the pilgrims and native americans may have been visited by aliens
in every journal entry we researched from those early pilgrims not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there
and what about the food  does the appearance of stuffing at the first thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology
uhhuh
what this isn't history
dude it is called history channel
yeah
and if we look in all the journals and aall the history books there is no reference to stuffing before  so where did it come from did it come from space we just don't know
did ancient aliens shape the first thanksgiving is it mere coincidence that cape cod when viewed from space looks like an alien life form  what exactly did the pilgrims experience  how exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every november
what
kyle why are you being so grumpy are you on your period again
we're not basing research for our report on this crap
okay let's take a vote who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report
dude
okay and who wants to take a little pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down kyle
alright fine let's just get this stupid report over with
yes a report from where  does congress know about this yet try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready i'll be there as soon as i can
darling
they found something this could be it
did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause
what
yeah god takes your period away and apparently it makes you really irritable i was thinking maybe that's why kyle's been so grouchy lately 'cause he's goin' through menopause
dude shut your fuckin' mouth
see what i mean you guys
is that them
that's them
you boys have been very busy  we need to know everything that you know
'bout what
have you been contacted by alien life forms
did you come across some kind of ship or something
dude look we we just saw all this stuff on history channel
we are the history channel  for years we've been collecting information on thanksgiving we're getting close to the truth and now you boys have exactly the same information it can't be coincidence
we saw it on your channel
what exactly did you seez
that stuffing was never heard of before  so it might be alien technology
my god would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview
alright butters that's enough mtv for one day you need to watch something that stimulates your brain i'm putting on history channel
okay dad
you're watching the history channel the only network dedicated to history coming up next it's monster quest larrh followed by hairy bikers errh but now back to part  of ancient aliens at thanksgiving
it has become a widely accepted fact that thanksgiving was a meal attended by pilgrims native americans and alien beings
stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until  and it might have been alien technology
and while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether could it be that pilgrims were actually aliens themselves
of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first thanksgiving just like you can't prove that the pilgrims themselves weren't alien can you prove that here draw that thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand maybe that symbol matches galaxies in space or something ooooooooooooo
could it be that the pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet history experts like kyle broflovski say yes
you might as well just say pilgrims and indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty
wow check it out dude we're on tv
how can they make a show out of this i wasn't even agreeing with them
what are you doing
uh oh
the first thanksgiving was a space treaty native americans are aliens
i was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po
haven't my people been through enough  goddamn you
ack dude
the white man is gonna pay for his lies
look at this sir  an aerial photograph of cape cod where the pilgrims landed in   five pilgrim settlements with plymouth rock here  the same symbols appear everywhere in history
the symbology lines up to mirrored points in space if kyle broflovski is right then plymouth rock is some kind of wormhole
pilgrims and indians were the aliens how did we not think of it
sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things
true dat
true dat
get all those tourists out of here we need this place secured
alight people let's clear out we need you all to disperse  this area is under quarantine
give me a piece of chalk  huh nothing
guess kyle broflovski was wrong
well at least we weren't outsmarted by a nineyearold kid  we should've known pilgrims couldn't be from space
here you can see it right there an object clearly fell from the sky and struck the earth
what is it
it's a pilgrim sir
so then professor broflovski was right after all
not long ago it was an accepted fact that civilizations on earth shared the universe with beings from other planets  these alien beings visited our world and once even settled it from deep within the galaxy canis major and a distant planet called plymouth
fellow pilgrims the great captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines we must prepare for war with the indians
now it is our time we shall attack plymouth and we will take all their stuffing
non mom did you already get stuffing for thanksgiving dinner
what hon
tell me you've already got everything we need for thanksgiving
uhoh thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away sweetie i haven't gone shoppies yet
oh no oh no
what is it hon
clyde donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage get your coat on mom we've gotta go to the store
you guys have stuffing
stuffing sure aisle
oh we're not too late mother come  hey where is it
it's right there right on the uh  wait that can't be right hey hey chet what happened to all the stuffing
what are you talking about
we got more in the back right
i just did inventory in the back it it was all put out here
you mean it's two weeks until thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing
oh no
no
no
no
you dare come to plymouth ambassador after attacking our stuffing mines
the stuffing mines were never yours
wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals ambassador this will be war
you are in no position to declare war your lead commander is nowhere to be found
and how knoweth you that
word travels fast in our sector
i do not give free bowls of stuffing what sayest you we will take back control of the stuffing mines
then the thanksgiving treaty will be off
and i pray to stuffing that you are wrong  where are you miles standish
and furthermore everything kyle broflovski said about native americans being from outer space was untrue native americans were brutalized and david sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology it was wrong to mix aliens and real history
i don't know dude have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to mars
dude there's a guy with a gun here
i'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked
yeah that's true
would you guys stop
just keep writing your apology
how now indian why hast thy race sent me here to earth
huh  ack
dude
you indians took me to thy planet and then cast me here why
go dude
yeah go on dude
woohoo
hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die tell me indian
i i uh i'm only one sixteenth
hold your lying tongue  this shall prove if thou art indian or not  ah he was not
i didn't think so
i have been told of your expertise kyle of devry institute i need your wisdom to get back to my planet
into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me  we must make haste to cape cod
who's this
this is natalie
hi guys
alright sir we got some more information on the pilgrim who crashed to earth thirty seconds after impact the pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat
who did the truck belong to
we believe it belonged to natalie portman sir
the actress that doesn't make sense
it gets worse all over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing we don't think it's coincidence
you're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage this pilgrim dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by natalie portman
look if anyone knows about stuffing it's natalie portman
we have to find professor broflovski he was right about all of this he'll know what to do
we shall make camp here for the night on the morrow perhaps we can reach cape cod and thanksgiving may yet be saved  what is wrong with kyle of devry institute
aw i think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing
he seems almost like a puritan lady whose period hath stopped  i fear kyle that you still do not know whose side to be on
no ah i don't
it must have been very difficult for you being the one on your planet with his wild theories that pilgrims and indians were not of this world
i actually only just said that sarcastically
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  then you are only just a remarkably gifted child  here let me show you your planet is one of the five  plymouth indi colthenheim and this planet over here nobody really cares about  the five are connected by a series of wormholes  my people came to your world and so did our enemies but we made a treaty and for  years our people have not fought but now the treaty is over
but i always read that native americans were here and that pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them
you can't believe what everyone tells you kyle you have to open your eyes  soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to plymouth and the stuffing mines can again be ours for he who controls the stuffing controls the universe
hold it right there
we found professor broflovski he is with the pilgrim
stay back all of you for i will get to cape cod and cannot be stopped come boys let us fight to the death
wait stop stop please mr standish we are all on the same side here we know why there's a stuffing shortage we've been trying to get the wormhole open
i trust none but them  indians hath betrayed us i must return to plymouth so my king can know the truth
please  we're the history channel we care as much about the truth as you do
then get us to cape cod as soon as possible
my lord my lord the battle is lost we have tried to stop the indians on their home planet but yea they are too strong
then our last chance for survival is gone
i'm sorry my lord all pilgrim forces sent to the indians' planet have been wiped out
and so soon the indians will be here sound the corn horn we must abandon plymouth
the stuffing mines are ours
earth is connected to plymouth by this wormhole here once i get back i will assemble my people to attack indi and gain control of the stuffing mines if all goes as planned you will all have stuffing in time for thanksgiving
but mr standish i'm afraid it's not that simple we tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work
ah ha ha ha of course not you have the correct symbol but you are missing the keeper of the portal
the keeper of the of course natalie portman
we were wondering what she had to do with all this natalie portman controls the wormhole
our window of opportunity is closing sir the wormhole has to be opened now
alright ms portman we need you to open your wormhole
mmmmmmmmmm no
please ms portman you've got to open your wormhole right now
mmmmmmm  uh uh
curses and cranberries i must get to plymouth now do as they say
mmmmmmmmmm no
there has to be a way to get the portal open where's our expert  what do we do professor broflovski
i'm not a professor
the history channel said you were
you are the fucking history channel
please kyle of devry institute there is no more time for squabbles the universe is at stake
you knew everything else you somehow knew about all of this you knew it here  you must know how to get natalie portman to open her wormhole
so do you uh do you have any brothers or sisters natalie
i had a lot of really close friends growing up but not any brothers and sisters i was an only child
wow awesome um
i have dual citizenship in the united states and israel  oh thanks
um so  so dual citizenship wow uh you know that i i never knew anyone that had that
well i went to harvard while i was acting i got a ba but i did classes at the university of jerusalem too
cool cool you wanna order some dessert
thanks that was a lot of fun
yeah it was cool thanks  um so is there any way you'd
what
you know could youuu
what
would you please just open your wormhole
oh  mmmm  no
errh
mmmmmmmmmm okay
yes
alright let's go folks
just for a sec though
thank you kyle of devry institute now the indians can be stopped and thanksgiving will be saved
yeeah you're welcome i'm sorry i doubted you and guys i'm i'm sorry i acted like a knowitall
it's cool dude we understand
i guess we should all realize  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand
now make way children for i have a war to fight  for stuffing
take all their stuffing
the treaty ends now
with the wormhole once again open miles standish was finally able to command a pilgrim army
now attack their left flank good they're retreating hit them with the antiindian device
the pilgrims fought off the indians making stuffing once again available on all our thanksgiving tables
yea stuffing mines yea
and now you know the true story behind thanksgiving
wow there's a lot about thanksgiving i never knew before
yeah history channel rules
but was the first thanksgiving really just about pilgrims and indians from space or was there something more shocking new evidence suggests that the first thanksgiving might also have been  haunted
there is certainly no evidence that the first thanksgiving dinner was not haunted
the pilgrims welcomed the indians but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave
uhhh
oh come on
you think you're man enough to fight me you little shit
yes 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit dad
you're both drunk pieces of shit both of you sit the fuck down
shoot him

pabst blue ribbon and white trash it's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home  this white trash home in colorado seems innocent enough
hmmm what the fuck
but the children in this home live in a world of neglect there's no heating no groceries  and if you look closely in the backyard you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab

yep to find out who the poorest kid in school is i actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch

heh heh yeah
well actually eric it's you

what is going on here mom what have you done were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime my mom is so poor she uses cheerios for earrings well guess i'm off to a foster home then  hawaii is my first choice something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away  gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now
when will you people learn to lay off the pabst blue ribbon now look at the camera and say i'm white trash and i'm in trouble
oh ah i'm white trash and i'm in trouble

yeah yeah
okay now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab
that's right
and it also says here that penn state prefers to be losing at halftime because at penn state they like when you're a little behind in the locker room that's a joke did you get that one it's a play on words we like to have fun here
wha' dude do you think this is funny
we just  no we just like to have fun here
well i'll tell you somethin' being from a lowincome household isn't funny oh heell no my momma's so poor she opened a gmail account just so she could eat the spam
what what is that supposed to be some kind of joke you think you're funny
a joke you think being poor is a joke
could be worse
how
could be in happy valley on a scale from  to  how old should you be to stay away from penn state
dude my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go greyhound off the handle
two penn state administrators walk into a butt
jesus this is a long drive are we in hawaii yet
hawaii
yeah that's where i requested to be sent
your foster home is here pretty much the exact opposite of hawaii
what  greeley
come on now this is not the way we told you to tidy up remember cleanliness is next to godliness so make it kind of clean but not too much amanda more ambiguous on the dusting  kenneth answer the door

what the fuck are you doing here
hello eric your room is upstairs to the left are you hungry
you're my new mom
you can call me mom if you like
alright mom how much money do you make like gross yearly income after taxes
this is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers you will be clean polite and most importantly you will follow the agnostic code we cannot know for certain if god or christ existed they could then again there could be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything can we be certain there isn't no so it's pointless to talk about now say it with me
goddamn i've gotta sleep in a room with six other people how poor are we
hey we do not take the lord's name in vain in this house just in case there is one do you understand or do you need the punishment room
oh heell now  mom dad's being mean to me mem meem

oh hey kenny who's this
this is eric cartman
does he live with you at the foster home
okay alright so listen i know our family is poor okay but before we lived there kenny was actually poorer than me so technically he's the poorest kid at this school
what are you talking about the poor kid at this school is jacob hallery

uh huh
let's put our hands up everyone 'cept for jacob his mom's so poor she only understands handouts
eric at greeley elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students
i wasn't making fun of anybody
a twentyminute song and dance number with forty seven yo momma so poor jokes directed at jacob hallery which ended in a finale with fireworks
i was just teasing
your case worker has been notified and he is not happy
my case worker  oh not this guy
i know this is a difficult adjustment for you eric but you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself i mean what do you think this is the shower room at penn state i'm kidding we like to have fun in our department so i was like oh look what is this like the shower room at penn state i joke around this is my head shot
will you stop with the penn state jokes all you're doing is taking topical and revamping old catholic jokes
oh oh and your momma jokes are better they've been around since the 's
what the hell does this have to do with anything
principal you've gotta send help to the playground they're about to beat up that new kid
aww look at the new kid and her wittle dolly you gonna cry some more in class wimp

shut up you foster twerps are all the same come on hand over the doll  who the hell is this
how about you find another little girl to pick on
mind your business peter pan
karen mccormick is off limits do you understand make sure everybody in this school knows
and if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence nobody knows nobody can know if any deity is watching over us amen
except for karen's guardian angel
what
where did he take you after he saved you karen
he just took me back to my classroom then he disappeared like always
what have he told you about making up angel stories
but we saw him he leaped down from the sky
and he kicked the crap out of jessica pinkerton
stop it children we do not speak such certainties in this house
get down to the basement all of you it's time for the punishment room
aaaaaaah
now did you see an angel
no i  no  i didn't see an angel
no you can't be certain of that you might've seen one  hit him with the dr peper again  are there such things as angels
maybe
good
what do we do kenny  kenny
what is the meaning of life
it's impossible to knoooow
that's right
who could that be
mr and mrs weatherhead i received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda
haha i told on you mom and dad
what business is that of yours
it's my business because child protective services is accountable for these kids  have i given you my head shot
yes yes we have that
okay now are you only giving these kids dr pepper to drink
if we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house then by goddish we'll do it the children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels
excuse me  let's have a look around
what the who did this
what is that
it was like a little mystery person flying around
almost like some kind of agnostic angel
oh my god  what's going on here
we don't know we can't possibly know
what have i done  i took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going i put innocent children in a dangerous environment what am i a recruitment coach for penn state  it's not funny
there's nothing in there but dr peper right there can't be
ohhh

what is it
it's like beer but different
but how did it get here
shut your mouth bitch

i'm white trash and i'm in trouble
get in the car you
wait a minute i'm white trash and i'm in trouble
no no take all these kids back to their parents we've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of it's like a penn state homecoming party
a false police report can carry up to a twomonth prison term son
i'm not saying it
we can do this the easy way or we can do it hard
i'm not saying it
then we'll add another charge for resisting
okay fine  i'm white trash and i'm in trouble
three arrests in just one powerpacked episode proving once again that we are all just one pabst blue ribbon away from becoming white trash in trouble sponsored by schlitz
well it sure is good to have you back kenny

a toilet
that's right it's a toilet clyde and where is the toilet seat it's up because you left it up again we've been through this countless times clyde
okay mom just not in front of my friends okay
no not okay because you aren't getting the message what if i'd fallen in start listening to me put it down put it down  thank you
dude that sucks clyde a mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilettime like that toilettime is the last bastion of american freedom
is your mom always like that dude
look could you guys just not say anything about this in school please
of course man it's cool
clyde clyde what have i told you about pissing on the seat and clyde's all like ah okay mom fuck not in front of my friends
cartman it was actually really lame
i know right women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap
wait a minute you're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out  but i thought you sit on the toilet this way  so that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk well because you got the flusher right here no  oh jeez that's embarrassing
clyde clyde  there you are
mom
clyde donovan you come home this instant
why
what have i told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom
mom i'm in class
how many times do i have to tell you clyde i was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up again
betsy come back home it's just not that big a deal
no roger it's a disgusting habit and i'm sick and tired of it if i had sat down i would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina
my grandma is from virginia
you're coming home right now and you're putting the seat down where it belongs let's go
dude i'm telling you it was fucking hysterical clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down he was so embarrassed dude i thought he was gonna die
i know fatass i was there
his mom his mom goes clyde you're an asshole and now i have toilet water in my vagayjay
that's not what she said you're putting extras on again it's not that funny
i know dude the bathroom is the last bastion of american freedom
don't you just feel a little bad for clyde
nuhuh
well you should the poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all
what's going on
they are trying to save clyde's mom
from what
they're saying clyde left the toilet seat up again
hang it there you're going to be fine okay stay with me now
i'm sorry there's nothing we can do
what
when she fell into the toilet she also made it flush it created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides
can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing
yes we'll have to but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs
but she's not gonna die is she
why did you leave the toilet seat up son
clyde clyde  clyde i want you to know i don't blame you for this we should have been hhharder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up
mom i'm sorry
shhh sh i don't have a lot of time clyde just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake please oh god please let me go let me go do it do it do it
mom
i'll always remember betsy donovan's kind nature more than anything she always treated people with dignity and respect  what a tragedy she had to leave us so soon but i'm sure betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet
i'd like to say on behalf of the departed that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down it's a man's responsibility to put it down it's not that hard
yeah yes that's right
putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard so is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl
my god people this is a funeral please have some respect there's a little boy here who has lost his mother  he'll never see her again because he couldn't take that sixthtenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing  and now little clyde's mother is dead and the blood is on his penis
crap it's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway phillip
oh hello ugly bob
hello terrance hello phillip
mom get the door
you're looking hideously ugly today ugly bob
how come you guys say stuff like that
because you're goddamn ugly
hello ma'am we're the toilet safety administration
the what
after the recent tragedy new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security can we come in
oh sure
who are these buttholes
it's the toilet safety administration hun they're gonna do something to the potty
my potty what are they going to do to it
hey hey that's my bathroom
oh yeah we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am
oh
you need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt
safety belt
federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in
dude you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump
this is for your safety a woman died you know
yeah but the blood's on clyde's wiener not mine
sir we are really worried about our friend clyde everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener
uhuh go on
we keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened
so we were just wondering if we could sue somebody
you can always sue somebody
all right you see clyde okay we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet
you got it  here we go the inventor of the toilet  sir thomas harrington in england died in
aw he's dead
so then we can't sue him
why not you can always sue somebody it's just gonna take some special protocol we would have to perform a sueance
aaaa sueance
you bet here at hoffman and turk we specialize in suing the dead if you hire us we'll work hard for you
wow really
you hear that clyde
now look i'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears  i warn you boys a sueance can be very expensive
how expensive
how much do you have
clyde got  from his mom's life insurance
wow that's exactly how much a sueance costs
wow that's weird
aw damn it  he hey officer
if you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt sir
yeah i know i had it on i just took it off for a second to get the uh to get to the uh
the address here is  avenue de los mexicanos
oh come on don't give me a ticket
gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in
i'm not gonna fall in i'm not a chick
the law is the law sir  you can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date have a good day sir
yeah thanks  asshole
you say something
no i was talking to my asshole cc'mon asshole let's get back to work
this is unbelievable stupid toilet safety administration you can't even take a crap at ihop without a forty minute line
shoes off belts off sharp objects go in the plastic tray

hey what's that thing
that's a camera it's a security camera
aw you people have me on camera now
it's okay sir there's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location
exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one it's time for us to stand together and say we want the government out of our bathrooms
yeah
now listen all we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down if they can't raise or lower there's zero chance of anyone falling in
hey yeah if there's no toilet seats the government can't make toilet seat laws
alright let's do it
no no hold on if the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it
no we won't
yeah you will
well sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms right
how about we agree to that if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate
well no you can't make men sit down to pee how could we play sink the boat
yeah how will nelson and i make an x on sleepover nights
what about us loggers hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine
well sorry but if we don't want the government treating us like children we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half
but folks been logging round these parts for generations my pappy taught me logging and his pappy before him
yeah i think we've just gotta live with the tsa
oh oohh the spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff ah aaaah
what's happening now
our motion has been denied by the judge  concentrate boys  this specter is like none i have ever encountered i managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim
so what does that mean
we'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow we'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in  bucks each
what
hang in there clyde this is all to make the world a safer place
security breeeach
an embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through tsa security with a gun and a baby leaving the toilet seat up the head tsa chief of operations had this to say
shiiiit
meanwhile outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy
what good is the tsa if they aren't protecting us why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet
and the toilet seat was up
we've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity
that's right
now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves
yeah
it is time for us all to grow up
that's right
it is time for a sueance
yeah
wait what what the fuck is a sueance
tom i'm standing outside the south park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor sir john harrington now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead lawyers are gonna try and sue him
sir thomas harrington your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions
no no
you will be sued spirit thy liability is without question  appear before this court harrington
never
quick everyone get our all your money
clyde clyde
mom
this lawyer is a fraud he has been swindling you and your friends for your money
fuck me it's a ghost
you can't sue the dead clyde putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette it's common sense clyde
oh boy here we go
don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something i have asked you time and time again to do  it's your fault
now hold on a second it's not anyone's fault  i am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine
there he is sir john harrington
quick sue him
you can't sue me  you're all using my toilet invention the wrong way  when you have to sit and take a sir harrington you're supposed to be facing this way  so you can use the little shelf for your books and your quill and your ink
aha i told you you should sit on it that way i told you
why would i design it so that when you're finished taking a sir harrington you have to stand up turn around and look right down at your harrington to flush that's gross
yeah but but if you sit on it that way you have to take your pants all the way off
of course why do you think i designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole
that's what that hole is for oh  oops
so then so then clyde's mom's ghost was all like clyde what have i told you clyde you asshole and clyde is all like mom leave me alone i'm seriously stop please dude it was a riot
that's not what i said
hah yeah well i'm just glad that stupid tsa crap is over with i know you've had a tough week clyde but at least your mom didn't die for nothing i mean we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of american freedom so technically your mom did die for nothing but clyde clyde

what he said which i find mildly amazing was that he thought i would have a hard time debating barack obama

tango tango i'm in position
copy tango clear vantage point
it will have to do we're not getting closer
alright butters bring it in
equipment is flying in ten seconds
copy that  seconds cartman
i can hear kyle just tell me when to go
we might have a problem
what's that
we just got word somebody might try to faith hill this event
lock down the whole perimeter nobody is faith hilling not on my watch
i think they're onto us guys let's do this  i got it
hey somebody is under the stage
go cartman
we got it we got it
go go go
hehe hehe that was sweet you guys
first there was planking  people taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the internet planking was soon replaced by owling  and after the super bowl by bradying  but the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs  it's called faith hilling and all around the world people are doing it  kids adults and even notable celebrities are getting into the act  but as faith hilling is more and more popular the question on everyone's mind who will be the first to die doing it
i have been sent here because you children are playing with fire  faith hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying from football quarterback to football singer
oh please bradying is to  and lame
i know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool but the truth is memeing has been around a long time we're gonna watch a film strip now that's a little dated but i think it gets the point across
for many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time the latest meme has also become the most deadly it's called tebowing
this is ryan and barkley they're about to learn how dangerous tebowing can be
here is a good place i'll do it right here
i don't know ryan you sure this is a good idea
stop being a scaredycat it will just take a second how could i get hurt
okay hold still  what's that
a traaain aaaaaa
ryan
no no nooo no no no no noooo
ryan
learn from me
this sure is a nice car tommy  would you like to get a picture of me tebowing in it
sure  what is that
oh my god it's coming
god no  no no
tommy ddid you get the picture
hold on wait hold on
hurry hurry aaaaa  eeeaaah
be careful up there pete
just go on and take the picture
these youths paid with their lives for tebowing when they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes peace signs  bunny ears  and fake wiener  maybe you think this doesn't apply to you maybe you think your memes are safe or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme well if you are watching his in the future  get off your flying cellphone scooters and think just remember  use the approved poses if you want to be a memer peace signs bunny ears and fake wieners
oh god that was boring
totally
so what do you want to do now
well there is the nice french caf downtown maybe we should get some faith hilling pictures there
oh that's a good idea
what you mean you guys still plan on faith hilling after what we just saw
butters faith hilling defines our generation
well count me out
you're gonna give up on faith hilling just like that butters how could you
well i'm scared
hey did you see today's newspaper
why would we look at a newspaper retard
you guys made the front page
really
dude we are on the front page
yes
yeah dude
can we get a different pose please
what's it say what's it say
it says oh oh no it says faith hilling is now all like late
what let me see that
how can that be already
public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely pass
how can we be pass we're only in th grade
faith hilling is pretty stale said republican candidate newt gingrich if they had crashed the debate by taylor swifting that would have been impressive
taylor swifting what the fuck is that
that's all it is
you pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog
but that's stupid  how can that replace faith hilling it doesn't even make any sense
i can't believe people take the time to do this garbage  this has to be stopped you guys
okay hold it there okay that's good don't move
how is this kyle this good
yep that's great
cool these will be good uploads
hey what are you doing
faith hilling why don't you get the fuck out of here
oh god faith hilling is so february
saying something is so  and anything is so  you stupid ass wipe
come on guys it's not worth it we can do our taylor swifting somewhere else   knock it off
why don't you make me
yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe  faith hilling taylor swifting these are things that will get you killed  that's a loaded  how many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded  on a yearold's desk well if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead pick the gun up
oh that's okay i think
pick the gun up you might as well swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun do you all understand my point
yes sir
good now put the gun in your mouth
ha
hey you're following plankers and tebowers so put a loaded gun in your mouth do it  everybody take a good look  this is what you're doing every time you play with internet memes you're playing roulette with your lives
professor lamont we need to talk
i will be right back
you're an expert on memes professor lamont
yes what is this about
we need your expertise sir
have you ever heard of another species memeing on the internet
another species what are you talking about
we were hoping perhaps you could help us understand  this  cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the internet with bread around their heads cat breading it's called it's just such an odd thing to do we thought would you explain it to us
they're evolving cats are evolving
sorry
there are two ways a species evolves physically from genes and culturally from memes just like genes memes replicate mutate and adapt
we're having a hard time following you here
look in the s there was fonzing  which replaced the outdated mustaching  in the s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodlefisting  but even that evolved from people ass wedging in the s  even before photographs humans memed for portraits all the way back to the egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking
you are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme
if they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are
mr kitty do you mind explaining this  you wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the internet with bread around your face this is a bad kitty bad you're taking the idea of faith hilling and making it stupid bad kitty  bad mr kitty  bad kitty no more memeing  come on guys  bad mr kitty
well i'm glad we took care of that
yeah what do you guys wanna do now
i was thinking of maybe faith hilling at the place they do aa meeting
that's a cool idea
oh fuck it dude
wwhat's the matter kenny
i don't know that seems quite pointless
what seems pointless
hey just accept faith hilling is out of style
hey  faith hilling is not out of style alright
well and i can't take any of that
no no no these stupid fads are only that okay we can't give in to this crap
don't give up on faith hilling kenny don't you give up on her
two boulder children died today while oh long johnsoning in a battling cage oh long johnsonning is of course the latest internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say oh long johnson on video before getting out of the way
you ready you ready
i'm recording go
oh long johnson oh long johnson ooh long
larry
this latest internet meme is shocking but most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety
oh long johnson oh long johnson oh long johnson
the cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death
oh long johnson oh long johnson
yeah that's good now go back the other way
oh long johnson oh long
dude what's going on
oh hey guys how's it going
we thought you were meeting us at cartman's what are you doing here taylor swifting
he's not taylor swifting that's old stuff
yeah now you're doing to see how many times you can say oh long johnson i thought just you know try it out
guys remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war what was his name
benedict arnold
oh come on you guys need to realize that faith hilling is over okay  you can pretend all you want but it's not coming back
kenny
i'm sorry guys faith hilling is just a stupid fad right
if you guys wanna keep faith hilling i'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home
you will like this kenny pull down your pants
you guys are sellouts
come on kyle
you're freaking sellouts
it's okay man come on
what the hell do you think you're doing do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire
oh long johnson
oh very funny people are dying out there is that what you want
oh long jeeea
you cats want a war because that's what you're going to get
oh oh oh
long ago there was tebowing which evolved into faith hilling but the latest memeing craze swiftjohnsoning may now also have its rival  a brand new meme where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing they call it reporting and safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal  oh oh long johnson oh long johnson
yeah yeah that's cool bring the left titty out some more  yeah yeah freeze there
what are those boys doing daddy
oh i think they're faith hilling bobby it's a little before your time
how droll
get a couple facing the other way brah
yeah good idea
hey you kids faith hilling in front of my clinic 'cause i got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine  get it
go back to the s faggooots
we have to face it cartman

yes yes this whole coming week is the jewish holiday of passover yes it's all about how moses led the hebrews out of egypt very good so on friday all jewish people will celebrate passover with a seder dinner  because god commanded the jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise
wow that's so cool and so then passover lasts seven days
yes yes one week from seder dinner on friday to the next friday
interesting and why is it called passover again
well because in ancient egypt god passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb
so interesting wow
get out of here
oh hey kyle
get outta here
well i better be going thanks so much ms broflovski i learned a ton
well you're very welcome
what are you gonna do
isn't it possible i just want to learn more about the jewish faith
no
alright kyle listen  legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from mexico that sucks the blood of goats and it might have just spotted in south park
what does that have to do with passover
all i can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable passover ever  cartman's passover holiday special starring the jewpacabra
alright next please signing up for the easter egg hunt
hoh da lolly this is gonna be so much fun
yeah i can't wait for sunday
me too
yeah yeah it should be a real blast heh i just hope jewpacabra doesn't show up that's all
jewpa what
jewpaca look it's nothing forget i said anything
okay  so anyways are they saying what time the event starts
okay look a lot of people claim that on passover a blood sucking creature called the jewpacabra comes out and preys on children this year passover happens to be the same week as easter
you mean it's like like a monster
it's just a legend alright but people all over town have started reported strange things knocked over trash cans weird howls
nuhuh
yeahuh token don't think it won't come after you just because you're black
you guys check this out
alright alright stay back stay back it definitely looks like a jewpacabra attack but it's hard to tell
aaaaaahhh
alright guys we're gonna need some video cameras we gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing
alright alright knock it off stop spreading lies
i'm trying to protect people and why are you so quick to try and cover up jewpacabra's existence
i looked on the known species webpage there's no animal called a 'jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere
well neither is bigfoot kyle but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a sasquatch
if someone says they saw a sasquatch they are either lying or they are stupid now stop lying about a jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you
lu lu lu lu nno such thing as jjewpacabra people made it up  it's  that's okay even if there was a jjewpacabra it couldn't get in my rroom anyways
butters
aaaaahhh
come on butters you and me are gonna try to catch jewpacabra on camera
no it's a school night
butters do you know how many times jewpacabra has been shot on video zeero  i can't do this alone please help me prove to the rest of the world jewpacabra is real
look at these dense trees and brush oh yeah this is exactly the kind of forest jewpacabra likes to hide in
you think jewpacabra is here
pretty sure jewpacabra was here
oh good maybe we scared it off
you can't scare a jewpacabra butters don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of christ  did you hear that i'm going to try a jewpacabra mating call now no christ no christ i'm really not buying this whole christ thing  he's here somewhere
oh god i'm scared
jesus is a lie
eric stop it
shh help me call it out butters
i'm not saying jesus is a lie
butters do you wanna catch jewpacabra on camera or not  there is no christ
jesus is a lie
no way jesus was son of god huh butters
nope i don't think christ has any basis in reality
sh you hear that
oh hamburgers
we started sooper foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe we are not canceling our easter egg hunt because of some wild story
i didn't think you would believe me and that why last night i took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video  what i'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a jewpacabra  and you're the first to see it  this is just after  pm first we heard rustling in the bushes then a strange animallike scurrying sound that's when we saw this  'kay wait for it wait for it wait for it wait for it wait for  right there did you see the jewpacabra i know it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing watch again  wait for it wait there  jewpacabra there's a jewpacabra in south park god help us
that wasn't a dog
it was no dog i was there i'm telling you this thing had no idea that jesus christ had died for our sins
what
i can try to catch it but i'm going to need all the resources you've got if this thing isn't contained your easter egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath
mr billings
there's two things that separate sooper foods from all the other grocery stores fun and safety what do you think peters what are the chances that this 'jewpacabra' is real
i'm estimating somewhere around
we can't afford to take that chance get this kid whatever he needs
so where are we heading first
we need to get to the city of nassau in the bahamas here
the bahamas
that's right there's a resort near there called 'the atlantis hotel and casino' they have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank
weeeeeee oh yes oolll check it out heheyeahehe
where to now
now we head back to colorado here  we need to get my video of the jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it
would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth
people thought atlantis was a myth kyle but i was just there i've explored the depths of atlantis and now i'm about to prove a new species exists i'm a little james cameron
these people aren't going to prove anything to believe any of this you either have to be a liar or stupid
these are professional people who go around tracking sasquatches kyle they aren't liars and they aren't stupid
look at its trajectory it heads directly to the right
it can't be human it's too low to the ground what do you think bobo
bobo thinks scary
it's definitely something i'm thinking a sasquatch
it's not big enough to be a squatch
so it's a baby squatch
that's what i'm thinking
i've already done my research boys what you're looking at there is a jewpacabra
jewpacabra
it's like a sasquatch only more elusive more ferocious and a little more greedy
oh jewpacabra that sounds scary
but it makes total sense if we rule out a human and a baby sasquatch jewpacabra is all we really have left
well i guess that's it you're going to have to only allow me into the easter egg hunt sir i'm the only one qualified
all the kids will be so disappointed
whoa look at this i just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video it's all orangie
but it's supposed to be all yellowy my god this really is proof of a jewpacabra
heh what do you mean
we've never seen this before it really is true
well i mean it could have just been a dog
no it's impossible look at the zoomy in if i drop image of a dog next to it  that thing is way to big to be a dog and check out the thermals coming off of it
that's the thermals they make a proof and the thermals
that's right bobo whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell
well come on guys it's probably a jewpacabra but this isn't definitive
i'll tell you one thing kid you're pretty brave
why
'cause you took the video of this thing it's not gonna like that
if it is a jewpacabra he's gonna be coming after you
there's no way no way jewpacabra is real  those those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about they just they just gave me a case of the hebrew jeebies that's all eh eaah  hey jewpacabra can't be real right tell me again why it can't be real  i mean it's impossible that something i made up could turn out to actually exist huh kyle
what are you doing
okay okay even if there was a jewpacabra it wouldn't know i was the one who got video of it huh how could it know that it couldn't know that right kyle
jesus loves me this i know'cause republicans tell me solittle ones god will protect'cause letting kids be harmed is child neglecteverything still clear out there
guys
it's all quiet out front eric
well check everywhere i'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes
he says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes
what what was that butters token  oh jesus christ you guys aghgh  you guys guys
hey eric
it's trying to get in where the hell are you guys
well we got scared so we're next door at wingstreet
wingstreet
yeah well it was the closest place to hide
dude i want wings  ahghgh  oh jesus it's only you
alright grab him
huh
you say the jewpacabra hunts for anything easter and now it's looking for you
get me outta here please heelp
look we're sorry but if it's you that jewpacabra wants we don't have a choice
oh god it's gonna kill me  what the
just a little blood to try and draw it out we just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow our entire business is based on fun and safety
this isn't safe or fun
maybe it won't even show up maybe we'll all make it out of this okay  oh fuck we better get out of here
no come back come back please this isn't right
hello young man let me start off by saying sooper foods is absolutely not an antisemitic company  but if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on easter children we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat thank you
kyle hey kyle  i know what you're thinking kyle that like this is some kind of fitting comeuppance
admit you're lying and i'll let you go
oh of course i was lying kyle there's no jewpacabra now please kyle it's easter eve and if jewpacabra smells this blood i am in a heap of trouble  no kyle no wait i'm sorry i couldn't help it kyle please i'll give you money i have lots of money  oh god what am i doing  i mean i mean i don't have any money i'm totally broke  oh god i am in a heap of trouble
it's so cool that even though i'm christian i celebrate passover too yup i think both holidays are awesome  i really sympathize with those jews in ancient egypt i really do
what'dya think bobo
no doubt about it it's a three foot tall bunnyman
i told you bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times shoot it bobo
bobo shoot it
bobo bobo no  wha
bobo got it bobo got the bunnymaaan
good shot bobo
now what do we do
i know let's go get a show about it on animal planet
good idea  wait wait wait wait we're gonna need to take the evidence
alright  i got the evidence right here the dart gun i shot the bunnyman with
alright come on let's go
ugh what where
ugh what  what's going on
the plagues the plagues are upon us run
it's raining frogggggsss  kyle kyle my hebrew friend did you see that it's raining frogs
yes it's because the pharaoh won't give the hebrews what we want god is angry
so god makes it rain frogs that just seems kind of mean to frogs kyle
that's how god is and if pharaoh doesn't give us what we want next he's gonna kill all egyptian first born boys
wha okay look i'll talk to the pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind
it doesn't matter because god is going to harden the pharaoh's heart
what does that mean
it means jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the pharaoh from letting us go
well that doesn't seem very fair kyle i mean if god is going to make pharaoh say no then why would he punish him for saying no
that's just how god is
you're wrong kyle god is not a dick
daaad when's it gonna stop raining frogs
it'll be okay my son the weather will clear
but my friend kyle he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the jews leave
it's a complicated political issue my son an economic social issue that needs time we can't let them leave but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the usa
wow that makes sense don't think anyone can deny that
poor frogs i feel so badly for them
but dad my friend kyle says that if we don't do whatever the hebrews want us to do god is gonna kill little egyptian boys
hah i don't think god would do such a thing little one no matter what happens we can't let ourselves believe in the hebrew version of god we believe in a just lord who would never murder innocent children
i love you dad
and i love you son and our love grows
and our love grows
and our love growslike the mighty river of the nileriver of the nilesee it flowwe'll never be apart
have no fear for god is nearand god loves all his childrenhuh  nooooooo  kyle why what are you doing
this is what god told us to do
no kyle i don't believe you
you'll see
noooo
what's happening to us
noooooo
mom don't let god kill me
noooo
care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
no the bread's all flat no  aaaaahhhh
son we were wrong i was wrong
we were wrong i'm sorry god i'll be jewish i promise please don't kill me don't kill me doooo
no no the bread is all flat no
there are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping fun and safety on this beautiful easter morning we are thrilled to give back to he people of south park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number   in fun and number  in safety let the hunt begin
i'm alive  i'm alive you guys  i don't know how but i'm alive  can you believe it it's a miracle  listen everybody last night i almost died but then a passover miracle happened the jewpacabra passed me over and by the power of jehovah i somehow woke up safely in my bed i learnt a big lesson it's wrong guys christ didn't die for our sins and god is angry it's time for us all to stop this easter ridiculousness accept jehovah as our god and deny christ
oh stop trying to ruin easter you you heathen
hey guys listen  i finally know how you feel kyle know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else it's so hard for us jews but i guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe
yeah
ii know what you're thinking kyle but i really do believe in judaism now i'm not lying
i know you're not
kewl thanks kyle oh and kyle happy passover
happy passover cartman

alright kyle that's enough i'm not gonna be bullied by you okay
what you were waiting for me in the bathroom
oh yeah
look this is all getting way too big tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them
this video can change how people think about bullying it needs to be seen by everybody kyle
if it needs to be seen by everybody then why don't you put it out on the internet for free  well
what what was the question again
if you really think every kid in america should see your antibullying movie then why don't you put it on the internet for free
get get out of here kyle i'm trying to go to the bathroom
fine but when you're naked and jackin' it in san diego don't ask me for help
why does he keep saying that
we all know that bullying has become an epidemic like aids bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises but now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself  i'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film stan congratulations on all your success
well i just got tired of seeing people like butters getting pushed around and i knew i had to do somethin' about it

kyle
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell
aaaaaaah i can't take it
somebody help us
trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out  the fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape
we were stuck we were completely stuck
kyle hurry
kyle wake up you've gotta wake up kyle
for four elementary school boys an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of i should have never gone ziplining
oh god
no
help we're trapped  we've gotta get out of here
it's the last day of spring break  and all over the small mountain town of south park  students are trying to have as much fun as possible  for ten year old stan marsh and his friends kyle eric and kenny the last day has come too soon
we really had spent the whole spring break watching tv and playing xbox you know so we we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous
we could go to the city pool they have a water slide
noo nono i'm not getting in a pool with kenny he has herpes
what
look at his lip  you've got herpes dude
this is not herpes it's a cold sore
no cold sore is what girls call it kenny it's actually herpes
come on guys the day is wasting away what would be something really cool we could do
and then like out of nowhere somebody came up with the idea of ziplining
hey yeah ziplining that could be really cool
we've definitely not done that before
i think there's a place just outside of town i'll see if my uncle jimbo will drop us off
cool ziplining
ziplining hell yeah
within thirty minutes the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from stan's uncle jimbo
we were in a good mood just jokin' around you know mostly making fun of kenny's herpes
hey kenny you got herpes dude ah i almost touched him  zi  oh sick kenny no gross
dude it's just a fever blister
heh did you hear that guys kenny said it's just a fever blister  you sound like a chick kenny that's herpes dude you got that shit till you die
it's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter
hey you guys here for the  o'clock zipline tour
yeah
all right let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar
and so they put us in these harnesses and helmets i thi think that's when we started realizing oh wow this is actually pretty dangerous
all right you guys look ready to zipline
alright
okay just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others
and we were like other we have to do this with other people
hi there
hello
hi
the boys have just made a sobering discovery  for ten year old stan marsh the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down  the average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family  but in a tour group the brain has to work overtime acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour
hey how are you
good how are you
so then we sit there for like thirty minutes because we had to wait for this couple who was running late
alright our last zipliners are here
sorry we made you wait everybody
inside kyle's mouth the muscles contract to force a smile even though in his brain kyle is thinking dude fuck you
we don't mind
now everyone was there we thought things would start getting fun but that's when we had to watch the safety video
welcome to backcountry adventures well hey there michael
hey there michael
it was i don't know ten maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell
oh and don't forget to take in the nar back to you michael
thanks michael  anybody have any questions
no
i have a question can we review the best ways to hold a rope again
really you're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand really
let's get out there and get zippin'
jesus christ
finally
the boys think their ordeal is over but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse
here we go guys zipliniiin'
everyone just step on in the shuttle
shuttle
how how long do we have to take the shuttle
it's about fortyfive minutes
it's a devastating blow for kyle it's almost too much to bear  his brain is already lacking excitement and now just the word shuttle makes kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be
well come on we don't have a choice
alright guys should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit
uh that's okay
well my name's pete nichols and this is my wife donna and uh make a long story short we came out here to see our relatives who live down in moab they uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now and uh long story short they told us that as long as we were in the rockies we should try ziplining so long story short we looked around in the newspapers and on the internet and on billboooards and you know make a long story short we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try so then we called and we made a reservation and that's when you know long story short we just thought
it's almost three o'clock and the boys are still on the shuttle
we're gettin' close are you guys gettin' psyched
wooo
but what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing  last night eric cartman had kung pao spaghetti from california pizza kitchen  inside eric's stomach the kung pao has just met with the del taco he ate for breakfast it has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque bk toppers that have been building up for months  and now to compensate for all the annoying tourists eric is ingesting massive amounts of mountain dew  the caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fastfood liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas  when the gas is released it carries with it tiny particles of eric's fecal matter  fecal matter which floats up and into kyle's nasal passage
dude did you fart
mmmm no
alright buys we're here
thank god
alright here we are looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today uh but before we climb up and start ziplining does anyone care to know about these trees' biology
the trees' biology
we are running a little late but if anyone really wants to know we could take a few minutes
i think we're good
i'd like to know about the biology of the trees
okay well this is a ponderosa pine it covers a more extensive area than other ameri
so after asshole gets his biology lesson we finally get to go ziplining
alright remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work  now when you're about halfway down the zipline the camera's gonna take your picture so when i call out shockabra look up and give the camera a nice shockabra  alright you ready
yeah
ready to do some zippin'
yeah
alright let's hear you say zipliiine
zipliiine
shockabra
woohoo alright nice zip
well how was it cartman
totally fuckin' stupid dude
oh really
yeah dude it's fuckin' boring as shit
alright kyle give me a zipliiine
zipline
shockabra
it was like having the life sucked out of you that' all it is sliding down a cable maybe without a tour group it'd be kind of fun maybe but this was just a complete disaster
after a grueling twenty minutes waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time and that is when the unthinkable happens
alright guys let's get movin' only ten minutes till our next zipliiine
the next zipline what are you talking about
eexcuse me wwe aren't going back now aren't we done
this is zipline tours we got sixteen more to go
and it was like wham
stop
noooo
everyone back in the shuttle
noooo
the boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun
anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross
yes
aaaa
ack went the little frog one day ack went the little green frog
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
let 'er rip
zipliiine
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell
next zipline's up here we call it the terminator
wugh
trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group
but you know to make a long story short i woke up this morning and
could you get another picture of us
aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
the fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape
i'm so fucking bored
alright you going next ricky
help somebody help us
it's no use there's nobody around for miles
there could be a helicopter maybe one will fly overhead
face it stan nobody's coming for us
zipline
woohoo
we should have never listened to you kyle
me
yeah you in the park this morning i know let's all go ziplining we've never done that before
oh no don't try to pin this on me you're the one who brought it up
i brought it up because you already brought it up
that's when i realized nobody remembered nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining me
you fat piece of shit
fuck you kyle
guys guys does it really matter whose idea it was
yes
alright look we can make it you guys we can't panic if the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster we are gonna make it out of here okay
but what the boys don't realize is that eric's body is already shutting down from stage  diarrhea  inside his stomach bile has just dislodged an arby's ultimate angus in the average human this would only cause mild diarrhea  but eric cartman is now drinking double dew a mountain dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular mountain dew  his rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste  the diarrhea shoots out of eric's anus and into his underwear  eric cartman is a ticking time bomb
dude did you just shit your pants
nnnnmo
so i just tried to keep the tour group moving as fast as possible
all right guys this is where we're going to break for lunch
come in by the waterfall gang
oh no could could we skip lunch and keep going
skip a free lunch not me
wo wants sandwiches  we got turkey  ham  turkey ham
long story short we picked up our bags and went to our hotel
oogh ugh you guys seriously something's wrong in my tummy
the stop drinking double dew fatass
this is diet double dew kyle it only has half the caffeine and sugar of double dew  oh man you guys i gotta get to a bathroom fast
you're in a forest go take a crap
if i crap in the woods the blood will attract beavers kyle
hey ah i'm so sorry but we have an emergency our friend is really really sick
oh you mean the little kid with the herpes
yyyeah
that's not herpes it's a cold sore
right sorry
yeah his his cold sore is really bad and uhh he's losing blood so we've gotta go
jesus sorry dude but we're at the summit the only way down is to zip down
zipline wooo
what about the stables
oh yeah the stables there's there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses i i bet they can get you back
suddenly stan says he knows about some horse stables ih it seemed too good to be true
now let me get this straight you want four horses one for each of ya
yea please
well i think we can set ya up
oh thank god
you see guys this is gonna be sweet after all
step right out here we'll get you going  got four more for you duncan
nooo
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell
aaaah
eeeeugh
trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour
can we please go faster
i can't take it
we got some lunch set up for ya up ahead some turkey sandwiches and diet double dew
aaaaaaaaaah
uh oh
so anyway long story short i was born in  at six in the morning
an attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on i should have never thought horseback riding would be any better than ziplining
this here waterfall is called heartbreak falls would you all like to know why it's called heartbreak falls
well i certainly would
kyle kyle kyle come on wake up
just go go without me
no we're not leaving you here kyle
i can't take it anymore  why do people say long story short they're not making it short stan
i just sat there watching kyle die and i wanted to tell him the truth right then and there but then this fire rose up inside of me i i thought i can find us a way out i ran off and went searching for i don't know how long twelve minutes and that's when i found it
you guys you guys get up listen to me there's a lake a hundred yards down that way they've got a marina with boats just sitting there
a marina
we can take a boat you guys we can probably take it all the way back to fairplay
what's the point
come on you guys a boat all to ourselves it'll be fun what could possibly go wrong
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell  trapped on a foot powerboat  which is only allowed to go five miles an hour
because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea
well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining you fuckin' jew
ziplining was your idea you fatass
the fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape
kenny whose idea was it to go ziplining mine or kyle's
i don't know i really don't give a shit
for four elementary school boys an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on i should have never got on a goddamn boat
oh no  you're not stinking up the entire boat you're taking a crap off the side into the water
beavers
after cleaning cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers the boys have made a terrifying discovery that boating is just as boring as ziplining
the boat went really slow and it just went round and round
waaaaaaaaaaaaah
if the boys fall asleep now from the lack of excitement they could die
here  everyone drink some mountain dew
i don't know ii just thought if we all drank the mountain dew the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake i told cartman he has to share it
i'm not sharing with kenny he has herpes
hey  fuck you cartman
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell  and just when it seems it can't get any worse
kenny kenny
kenny mccormick has died of boredom
oh my god they killed kenny you bastards
no not they you look what your ziplining idea has done you killed kenny you're the bastard
it wasn't my idea it was yours you killed kenny you bastard
and finally i couldn't hold it in anymore i said stop it
stop it it was me my idea
you
four days ago i came across a brochure for ziplining  i thought it would be fun i only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together
so you intended for us to go ziplining all along why stan
if you signed up three friends you got a free ipod nano
you sold us out for an ipod nano
i had no idea ziplining would be so boring
you you killed kenny
you bastard you bastard stan
how many ipod nanos is friendship worth i guess one
the hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back  i mean it was the fifthgeneration nano so i can't trade it in anywhere
but then miraculously the boys' prayers are finally answered
it was a miracle he came to save us and take us back home
you came for us
mr hankey
thank you  mr hankey
howdy ho boys let's get you back home
we were saved it was over
after nearly four hours in the colorado wilderness the boys are finally going home from the boat the boys were airlifted aboard mr hankey's magical helicrapter  in the four hours since they had left home the boys had traveled so far that mr hankey then had to fly them on his seven turdy seven  from there it was only an hour ride back home on the poochoo express  four friends turn apart by tragedy  would now start the long journey back to forgiveness kenny mccormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents  and the boys received treatment for their herpes
no i didn't get herpes i just had a cold sore
kyle broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages stan marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining  his awareness videos became so popular that stan once again ended up jacking it in san diego as for eric cartman  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most in just two weeks he was back to drinking diet double dew defiant to dew the math
it's diet dude diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea
fellas fellas fellas  aaaah fellas
what
guess what larry barsky just told me
what
guess
just tell us butters
there's a new girl that started school here today and she's joined the cheerleading squad
oh we have a new cheerleader
what's she look like
yeah what's her name
alright guys alright if there is a new girl at our school we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights it's gonna be her choice who she likes the most

why why are you happy for me
dude i'm being seriously you guys will be really cute together what are you gonna say to her
nothing
what the oh token's shy oh my god that is adorable
and so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the greeks and the romans remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of westeroth the king of westeroth was who robert baratheon  and he asked eddard also known as of course lord stark to serve as hand of the king you remember that lord stark accepted or course the queen's family  that's the lannisters  were really trying back then to take control weren't they but where were the targaryens at this time well they were across the sea we all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne so we've got the greeks the romans the starks lannisters baratheons targaryens all headed for a big blowout right in season  now what i really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north because that's just a whole other mess
dude token  token dude  psst token  go ahead go ahead dude token yeah get in there

did you see that token was gonna push her but then he tickled her instead
dude why are you so into their relationship
i don't know it's just so perfect
you motherfucker
kyle jesus christ
what the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple
oh heard that through the grapevine did you
the new girl liked me and so you lied to her
somebody had to intervene kyle you were standing in the way of token and nichole they belong together
just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together you fat racist piece of fucking garbage
oh oh i'm a i'm a racist huh i'm a racist it's how nature works kyle look look what about luke covina and maria sanchez  is it a coincidence that they ended up together
actually i heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago
oh did they uh i hadn't heard about that
teehee that was us remember eric
shh quiet cupid me
what
nothing
who is cupid me
nobody
you are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple
why kyle so you can try and ruin things for token and nichole look at how happy they are  is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic
goddamnit
nichole your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school
his name is token he's really nice
well that's good but your mother tells me that this boy is black
so
well nichole it's just you know just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys it's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person
oh stop william there's nothing wrong with her dating a black person
but i'm not saying it's wrong i'm just saying she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there people turning their heads and saying oh look at the two black people together that figures
it's not like that dad we just happen to like each other i know it seems like a strange coincidence but it really is a coincidence
and we are very happy for you sweetheart here have some more turkey
yeah just try the white meat i know it's a little dry but there's a lot more of it
come on  other people have to use the bathroom you know can you hurry up in there

haahahaagh
artonius jackson catches the ball  he's running down the sideline  ohhhh
bohhhhh did you see that hit boooom
jackson stops at the  and he is slow to get up
that was a great hit boys remember that at practice tomorrow
yeah jackson took a real shot and  well i'm not sure what he's doing now but uh it appears as if he's looking for his keys dan
yeah and that doesn't make a lot of sense because ever since his concussion in ' he doesn't even have a license
coach martin is coming over to tell him that now but jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home
well during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the nfl roger goodell commissioner a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the nfl how's the league handling all that
well there certainly are interesting statistics coming out dan and we are deeply concerned anduh and waiting to see if there's really any direct correlation between football and head trauma
oh and it looks like some of the mfl alumni are takin' the field now there's allpro safety martin gregors  and fullback jim harris looks like his pants are down around his ankles
somebody should let him know oh and old surehand mike tafthill  who seems to be baking an imaginary cake dan
yeah not sure if that's meant to be a cake or or perhaps a a loaf of bread but he definitely thinks he's baking something
boy i just don't get football guess that's why i suck at it
you don't suck at football butters you suck at all sports
that's true old eric tells me i should work at a thai massage parlor i'm so good at sucking
that's right butters
and with that the browns are ready to kick it off back to the broncos
all right all right here we go boys watch them on the kickoff all right special teams are the most important plays
we don't have kickoffs anymore
huh
the school said they're the most dangerous plays so they don't have us do 'em anymore
wait wait wait wait whoa what the fuck
okay before we get started with this pta meeting does anyone have any outstanding issues
yeah i'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs
uh yes we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions m'kay
oh yeah we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football but i think i have a way to make it even better why don't we have the players just wear bras
bras
yeah the players should all wear bras and instead of helmets they should wear little tinfoil hats 'cause you know it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric
how would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer
oh you're all not getting it see while we're at it we'll have a balloon instead of a ball and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug
huh you you think the students would like that
oh they'd love it a sport where safety is all that matters how about we call it sarcastaball
hnkay would would you mind being the coach of the south park sarcastaball team
jesus christ yes i would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team
dad do we really have to wear bras
yes stan this is what people want don't worry you look really cool
i got the balloon coach marsh er what should i do with it
oh you know try to get it into the end zone but be really polite about it
okay hey hey heh excuse me pardon me heh  you guys look terrific wow this game is great
how's it going coach
how's it going awesome nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons 'cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about
so you're happy with these changes
happy i'm thrilled look at how much better this is
okay
is football safe for your kids concerned parent randy marsh says no and has started a movement to reform the sport gathering followers by the hundreds
oh this is good nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball  yeah yeah we're we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide  go on pat yourselves on the back
showing just how much one concerned parent can do marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of washington
yeah yeah let's do that we got the economy in the toilet a big election coming up but this country's number one priority should be making football safer
this is ridiculous are we really going to go out there and play north park like this
i can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him i'm so confused
this game is stupid i have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as i can to the other team
yeah you know what  screw this
hey whoa well i can't believe what i'm hearing  we've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game and you fellas just wanna quit
we don't even understand how this game is played
this great game isn't about plays it's about sportsmanship and compassion and when i look around this locker room well i see some of the nicest most compassionate guys i've ever met  well token you're nicer than anybody i know  and clyde well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field
that's true
are we just gonna let north park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us  bein' nice is about what's inside you when your enemy is nice to you you just be nice right back and if they give you two balloons well you give them three
yeah
and when they try anand thank you for those balloons you say ah i don't need any thanks i did it 'cause it was the right thing to do and then you give them a smile
yeah
and when that other team tries to cover you well that's when you gotta reach deep down right down to your creamy center well that place well that place inside of you where where all the goouey happylovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest most compassionate player you've ever been and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy
yeah yeah
let's do this  stan hook up my bra
as commissioner of the nfl i am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football oh but why stop there since football is so barbaric we should change too so let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the denver broncos randy marsh  congratulations marsh good job

oh well yeeric ah i told you everyone has a creamy filling inside them where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from oh didn't your dad ever tell you that
i don't have a dad
oh right i i'm sorry well everyone has a creamy filling eric and and some people have so much of that filling that it that it comes out sometimes a lot of times when i go to sleep and especially if i've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good sometimes i wake up and when i wake up i i realize some of my goo has come out  but i always make sure i keep it just in case i ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings
youuu save it all
my goo doesn't come out every night but i sure do seem to have a surplus of it
butters do you think your goo might work on someone else
i don't know weh i never really thought of it that way
hm it's kind of a grapey bleachy flavor
do you feel warm and compassionate
holy shit i think i do
welcome back to rome we're gonna talk some sarcastaball i can't wait i can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling  joining me now is the coach of the denver broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball randy marsh thanks for calling in randy really happy to have you on the show
yeah it's awesome to be on your show
randy first off thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare way to go
thanks jim 'cause it's totally what i intended you know when i came up with the idea i was sure it was gonna end up like this
well it certainly makes for an exciting game how about last night's nailbiter that ended zero to zero that's a game i wanna watch twice that's a game i wanna watch four times check that i'll watch that game five times  good luck on sunday i'm sure that'll be another game that i could watch twelve times check that thirteen times
thanks jim
randy aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner
oh yeah i've totally got time to do that sharon in fact how about i go downstairs and make a fourcourse meal for all of you check that a sevencourse meal
randy something's happened are you unable to stop being sarcastic
oh right i can't stop being sarcastic now
i'm telling you randy i think this sport is doing something to your brain
right it's doing something to my brain and now i can't stop being sarcastic
do you mean that
yes i totally mean it  help me sharon help me
all right first string cover those wideouts tell 'em how much you like their outfits clyde token hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss
awwwwww
cartman you idiot
stay positive stan all right guys cuddle up cuddle up  now what is goin' on out there
that kid is provoking us he's saying mean things to try and piss us off
yeah we need more of your mojo butters
oh all right well all right here you go
uh hum mmm  i'm sorry mr marsh but there appears to be permanent damage
oh boy this is great my week just keeps getting better
how do we fix this doctor
you don't i'm sorry there just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain
so that's it  i should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too
ohh rreally you you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball  really  that's fascinating please go on
no sarcastaball has nothing to do with it i just i just really enjoy being sarcastic and so i must be finding an excuse
you know i have a yearold alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family but let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains
my son is out there playing that game it's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety
okay well i've got a better idea let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases let's let's take all that money and make commercials that say hey america sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain
thank you doctor thank you so much
jim rome here hey i love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy but sometimes it's so thrilling i need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game that's when i reach for a bottle of this  butters' creamy goo
you play hard you need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost  sports these days are all about being nice so take your game to the next level  with butters' creamy goo  you'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine
like me
get with it and get the goo
butters' creamy goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs commitment compassion and comradery and now it's available in quart size
go and chug a bottle of butters' creamy goo
best served just above room temperature
red  sunshine and happy thoughts sunshine and happy thoouughts hut  oh no that kid's gonna intercept it  good job kid
stan stan
dad
get in the car stan we're going home
what
we're sorry stanley we don't want you playing this sport anymore
hey get off the field m'kay
everyone everyone listen there's something you all need to know about sarcastaball it turns out it's totally safe  yeah it's super safe it's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play itugh  oh sorry sorry hang on gotta not be so sarcastic ahem let me try that again listen everyone if you let your kids play sarcastaball you're a fucking genius ogh gyugh cut sorry let me try this again  look what i'm trying to say is we should have like  sarcastaball leagues because then everyone would  god damn it
stanley just get your things and come on we're going home
whoawhoa you can't you can't tell me what to do
yeah we're your parents we can't tell you what to do
don't you see what this sport has done to your father do you want to end up like him
oh right like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets
ohohh randy it's happening
mr marsh listen i know you care about your son but he's a heck of a player he's good at tickling laughing and getting along
look the point has been made okay i'm warning you being this sarcastic is dangerous
we're not being sarcastic dad is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence is it so hard for you to believe that when butters says competitiveness can be compassionate he's being completely sincere
i don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity
that's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it what you need is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness
yeah dad you need some of this
this is cum
and you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done  just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean you need to take it to oh who don't we just drink each other's cum sarcasm like that is homophobic chauvinistic and completely lacking in maturity any questions
what's sarcasm and what's com
we'll talk about that when you're older
come on everybody let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football
welcome back to rome some of you might have seen me on tv last night turns out the drink i endorsed was semen turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic that kid's probably grounded for a month check that i'm sure he's grounded for two months and a week football needs to be made safer so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen yeah that's a fastball right there that's a real stroke of philosophic genius more little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football and i don't know what else to say but so long sarcastaball it was nice knowin' you let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again probably won't not for another year check that couple of days
dad hey dad
what
my wiener is all stiff and pointy
oh well butters that's just the friendly compass see whenever you have friends in the area your little compass there tells you where they are it's pointing up because jesus is your friend
thanks dad
you find a good catcher's mitt cartman
dude how come when we play baseball i have to be the catcher
well because you got good coordination sharp reflexes and you're fucking fat
i'm not fat kyle
right you're not fat
dude i'm not fat i don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch
whoa duude
jesus christ you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy
excuse me  excuse me
see what i mean you can't even walk around a wallmart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a rascal
why do they even allow those things in stored
they don't just allow them they have them available at the front
you've gotta be kidding me
oh my god you guys look at this  candy corn oreos oreos with candy corn filling  holy hell yes
are you serious look around doesn't this bother you at all  that's you one day fatass not even one day if you don't change something that's you in about a year

yeah yeah here you go
hey kyle can i come in for a second
why
i've been doing a lot of thinking about what you said at wallmart  you're right kyle i'm fat  all these years you tell me and me saying no i'm bigboned or no that's just muscle it was always just me living in denial i'm fucking fat kyle i'm fucking fat as fucking fuck
cartman uh all i was trying to tell you at wallmart was that you
no it's okay kyle because i'm not gonna live like some slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around now that i can admit i'm fat i decided to finally do something about it  sweeeeeeeeeet
oh no
don't know what took me so long dude all i needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one see it's got a basket in front for my candy corn oreos
you don't need that get off of it
dude it's sweet did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere i can seriously go from my bed to wallmart and never have to touch the floor once
that's not what i meant by doing something about it cartman
hmm  i can't  i can't seem to get into your bathroom kyle
what
yeap no this is the problem kyle  you've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else i won't be able to take a shit in your house
so take a shit somewhere else
that's not the way this country works kyle  your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter  it's the law
what's going on down here
can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house mr broflovski doesn't appear to be handicapaccessible  i'll look past it this time but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit  well i'm off to go try to take a shit at best buy guys see you kyle
out of the way out of the way please
uhh i guess take that big booth by the window
okay we're finally gonna start with preboarding anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft oh
coming through oh how humiliating  scuse me gotta go to the front of the line oh what shame i feel  oh jeez look how fat i am i'm just mortified you guys can't believe i have  ay the fuck is this there's a wait for the rascal line hehay that kid in the middle isn't even fat look at him he's got no right to be on a rascal you're not fooling anybody asshole walk to the back of the line
i don't have legs
yeah well you got skinny arms  'scuse me move it
and so to go through all that your honor to go through all the shame and daily ridicule and then not to be able to take a simple shit at best buy  at besty buy i'm sorry  to be told by some best buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom  oh god excuse me it's just so belittling you know all i wanted to do was take a dump your honor after all i've been through can't i just take a dump at best buy
more lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms costing taxpayers millions opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of rascal tipping
stop it you kids sto oop owww weak weak
the government warns that rascal tipping can be dangerous and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor to counter the crisis the department of health has called for  million in aid so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device
oh yeah it's nice yeah that works pretty well
you have got to be kidding me
what kyle
we should not be wasting time and money making sure cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over
you condone rascaltipping kyle do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized
so get off your fucking scooters and pick them up
oh oh did you hear him  this is exactly what adele is talking about  our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like kyle  well i for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers  you should be ashamed of yourself kyle eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look  i'm not feeling shamed anymore from now on i'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash kyle i may be fat but i'm not honey boo boo
who's honey boo boo
dude you've never seen honey boo boo
my name's honey boo boo and i'm a beauty queen bitches  i'm fat as a whale and i don't give two shits girl
her favorite foods are sketti and butter and she likes drinkin' red bull and mountain dew
i'm only six and i've already had three heart attacks girlfriend
come on come on now boo boo  now get up and wave to them judges  we ain't got no shame about our weight 'cause our weight makes us sassy
jesus dude wwwhat happened it's like something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore
well dude it's not like the bar is this actual physical thing
this is it throttle down
throttle down
mr cameron you don't have to do this why don't you just go back to your house in malibu go work on another movie
i have to do this i have to try and raise it
the bar isn't something that actually lowers mr cameron
then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters  how do you account for honey boo boo the bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom if anyone can go down there and raise it back it's me  let her go  uv lights on pressure system is normal music on
his name is james james cameron the bravest pioneerno budget too steep no sea too deep who's that it's himjames cameron
systems are normal you guys hearing the song okay up there
james james cameron explorer of the sea
yes james we hear the song
descending to one thousand feet i don't see the bar yet looks like it must have sunk pretty low
with a dying thirst to be the first could it be yeah it's him james cameron
come on hurry it up in there
oh yeah that's good that's accessible now cool let me try to take a shit in this real quick
this has gone far enough  how can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us
yeah what we need is something to raise awareness
yeah we've gotta raise people's awareness
something like a documentary you know follow cartman around with a video camera and then get all his bullshit on television
yeah g'uh a a documentary
at least then we'd be voicing our concern i mean if you think about it we should feel some shame for complaining about it and not doing anything
you i gui guess you're kinda right
hey tell you what if you wanna follow cartman around and get a video of him i'll pay to make it into a documentary and get it on the air
really thanks dude i'm gonna go get a video camera
hey token if you're gonna get kyle to video that stuff for you you should probably tell him the truth
he doesn't need to know the truth kyle will get what he wants and so will i
ladies and gentlemen we have an epidemic in our country obesity is costing taxpayers millions and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed over the past several days i have filmed such a case and the shocking video has been edited by my partner token it is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue
he's chubby  he's filthy  and he's just a little bit nuts  here he is america's newest sweetheart fatty doo doo
fatty doo doo
who's that scootin' on a scooter fatty doo doowho's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do
what
nobody scoots a fatty doo like you doscatty foo foopatty poo poowhite president black president i don't carejust scoop me up some doodoo and i'll be right therei only know five chords six
come in
what have you done
i helped you make a documentary kyle
when we said documentary i thought we meant  minutes not honey boo boo
kyle kyle i'm trying to make compelling television
you got randy newman to do the theme song you're not trying that hard token you're a good kid how can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a about a fat child killing himself where's your sense of shame
i can remember exactly where i was the first time i saw honey boo boo i couldn't believe what i was seeing a shameful fat family eating white trash food to their death and then i saw what network it was on the learning channel  if they can feel okay about that why can't i
when the bar gets lowered token we all pay the price what if honey boo boo was a little black girl being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy
but she's not black kyle she's white  the bar is determined by society kyle and it's not something that can just be raised up  not by us or anyone else
you guys seeing this
yes we see mr cameron
this is where the bar was just a few years ago it was lowered here when president clinton got a blow job in the oval office and suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad but clearly something else has lowered the bar even more i must go deeper we're in the pipe five by five
i just don't know what to do i mean i hate cartman with all my heart but i can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him but should i feel ashamed oh whatever lowered the bar is not my fault so if i kind of go with it is it really unfair to cartman

erectile dysfunction is a fact of life you want to show her you love her but you're old and so is she  the next time that special moment comes don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune fake it with cialis  it won't make her any harder but it will make you not care for up to three hours  and then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on
hey sheila you feel like having some fun
oh dear did the cialis commercial turn you on again
how about i put on the uniform
oh gerald
huh what do you think you know you like it
oh hello
ups man i have a package from amazon for you
oh dear but i'm barely dressed
if you'll just  sign right here
oh you're so rough with me mr ups man
yeah  do you like your package ma'am
oh yes
huh
do it harder ups man
ike what's the matter  dude you've been in here crying all morning what's going on  oh my god ike aare you sure about this
yes yes
iike this is a big deal you have to be absolutely
i saw them kyle i saw them
oh no
you guys can't tell anybody all right not until i figure out what to do
dude what happened
take a look
what's this
ike found out last night my mom's having sex with the ups man
whoa
dude no way
yeah dude
but are you sure they had sex like sex sex or they actually had sex
yeah dude like fullon ike saw everything it totally makes sense now my mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from amazon lately sometimes shshe doesn't even remember what she's ordered she's probably been having sex with the ups man for a long time
ohhhh
well are you gonna tell your dad
i don't know i feel like i should confront my mom first but it's so embarrassing
kyle have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual
what
isn't it possible your mom was raped by the ups man we know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses think about it what kind of sane normal person would wanna have sex with kyle's mom
cartman dude not now
no hear me out you guys haven't you seen those adt commercials women these days get raped by perfectly normallooking white guys in broad daylight it may be too late for kyle's mom but i'm getting some god damned security
look look the thing is do we tell gerald or do we just stay out of it
how do you tell him hey gerald sorry but the ups man is bangin' your wife it's really none of our business
if my wife was having sex with the ups man i'd want you guys to tell me
how do you know she's not i mean think about it this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day who clearly has a kind of insatiable lust i mean somebody who would have sex with kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything
oh come on he can't be trying that with all our wives
wouldn't be the first time  hyeah there's a price to be paid with having things convenient used to be a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk hyeah but men got lazy they wanted that milk delivered right to the door only problem was the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife sure you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck  and now you got your amazon  and the milkman's come back  and none of ya are safe
and so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen the touch pads at the front and rear doors and breakin monitors on all windows i'm afraid those are not secure at all
oh no really
oh i'm sorry but i really don't think i can afford this
mom do you wanna get raped haven't you seen their commercials you can get raped by a white guy these days mom
ohhh
yes unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days
whatwhat do you mean
well many times houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows
oh my god i knew it kyle is always taking my stuff just yesterday i couldn't find my ipod headphones that sneaky little jew
we realize that's a lot of money mrs cartman but really how much is feeling secure in your own home worth
yeah mom there's dangerous people trying to screw us both
don't you need to be getting to work rand
no i think i'll uh just hang out a little longer  i'll get it
hey there looks like i got a couple of packagers from amazon for ya

you said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him how did you
we used a pretty blonde to lure him in when she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub she took off her clothes and asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk the milkman said you want that milk pasteurize and the blonde replied no just up to my boobs i can splash it in my eyes that's when we jumped 'im it was over in minutes then we burned his body you wanna get rid of the milkman you gotta kill him and kill him good and then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on
hey ey uh  you want me to do this you gotta pay up front kid

okay hold on
heh hello

no everything's not all right how come a guy from india is calling me when my house is being broken into
we have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute that takes a lot of employees manning phones
dude i'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the earth try and protect me
sir it doesn't matter where we call you from we still contact the police in your neighborhood
oh really oh okay gosh i'm so relieved thanks there's still just one little problem how do you know i didn't break into this house set off the alarm and now i'm stalling by being upset about the indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit raped my mom and you people have done absolutely nothing about it

and what do we tell our kids we can't leave them in the dark
wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark
what
huh nothing
now listen there's nothing more we can do to protect your homes but there's someone here who says he can
hello folks we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure now you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows motion detectors in the living areas and i would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home
whoawhoa wait wait what do you mean
protecting your home and your family is hard enough but sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough a new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored but your fear levels as well  a security system that is actually inside you it's called insecurity
we'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach
hehey what cute twins

they're so adorable  that i'm gonna bash their fucking heads in

mom dad you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic jewish tenet

hello
it's over but you were wrong we don't have to be afraid of amazon the only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves
yea' got yourselves some nice home security systems don'tcha payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house only problem is while you're out feelin' like your things are safe that security man is fucking your wife
doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running just call me whenever you need me back  ah who are you
it doesn't matter who we are what matters is our plan you should have respected my authoritay
hoo
fellas fellas
what
you'll never guess what happened butters just beat up scott malkinson
butters  why
it was crazy scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot and out of nowhere butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves scott told butters to shut up and butters just started whaling on him
you're talking about butters
dude i'm telling you butters beat the crap out of scott and then he locked himself in the bathroom
butters
leave me alone
butters come out here
get out of here all of ya
butters people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes now whatever your problem is you just
you just think you know everything don't you kyle every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about his image  you guys think cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school you're all fake and stuck up  and none of you have the courage to tell jimmy that his jokes aren't funny  the only kid here with any sense of dignity is kenny and the rest of you have your heads up your butts
well apparently kenny is butters' best friend you guys gonna make out kenny
and that's another thing you're always trivializing everything i say by gettin' the last word well you're not gettin' the last word this time
wow
double wow
i'm sorry but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse
butters what on earth has gotten into you
i don't know dad ah i was just pissed off i guess
do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates
i don't suppose it is but i don't give a darn
do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be mister
why don't you shut up dad and stick it in your ear for cryin' out loud
stephen are you thinking what i'm thinking
yes our little butters is flowering he has reached the age of panua
ehexcuse me
principal victoria this isn't butters' fault
it's not
it has to do with biology  you've maybe noticed that butters isn't exactly like other kids
yeah
you probably think butters seems somehow different
hey yeah all the time
it's because he is  his mother and i his whole family were we're not of this place
ah i'm sorry i really don't understand
please just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter he can't be helped by your discipline this must be dealt with by his own kind if it's all right with you we'd like an extended leave for our boy please it's a cultural thing
i don't want him to go stephen he's too young
it's our people's way linda you know that better than i do
then we can go with him
you know that's not allowed
will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on
butters you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa
uhbubut i'm from here
no we moved here just before you started preschool you were born in our native land butters  a distant and very secluded island world called hava'i
we're from hawaii
only haoles pronounce it hawaii butters but those of us from hava'i are a very special people we have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive  we drink chichi's from the coconut we eat poke that the safeway provides and when we've chosen a mate we marry at the fern grotto as your mother and i did so very long ago as a stotch butters you are actually hawaiian royalty your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the king
but what does being hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period
not an emo chick on her period butters like a salmon needing to swim back upriver all hawaiians feel it it is called hapahui apahoha and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home you must do your walkabout to your homeland butters and you must do it alone  take this son it is our mahalo rewards card it will provide you with all you need and now i must turn my back on you
holy shit balls holy shit balls guess what you guys holy shit balls
what
butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to hawaii
hawaii
he said he had to go back to his homeland and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut
dude what the hell somebody's gotta stop him
after all the things he said to us he can go ahead
kenny you're clearly his best friend go stop him
i'm not his best friend
yeah mr perfect go rescue butters so he can lick your balls some more
butters come on
they won't let me on the plane why i can't do anything right  no no i have to go to hawaii kenny i have no idea what's waiting there for me but i guh i can't go on like this

oh please iif it weren't for him i couldn't have come
very well we shall speak with the chief of our island and see come now
you folks are all native hawaiians too
yes my wife patty and i have been coming to kaua'i for almost five years and bill and donna actually own a time share in poipu
yes but poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists i'm afraid

what's saimin
it's one of the foods of our people
oh i get  off i'm a native here's my mahalo rewards card  mahalo  come on you frickin' tourist jesus buy a post card  these are the ancient ruins of our ancestors  they say the spirit of the king is still in there
you must stay away from this place it is kapu
kapu that means taboo  especially to haoles
uh that there is bubba's burgers  in havai'i us natives say bubba's bruk  here's the sheraton just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists here's where many of us natives live the sheraton residences  it's all right we're natives  protector and chief i present to you the keiki butters stotch
ah stephen and linda's child last time i saw you you were the size of a coconut who's the haole
my dearest friendsi am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of kava'i what can i tell you of this mysterious island and its people it is a place of wonder and yet to the outsider like me a place of odd tradition the people here are peaceful and joyous and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk pineapple juice and vodka which they call the chichi as for butters he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors and seems to be feeling better with every passing day he still seems quite angry at times but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow
on the morrow what the fuck is wrong with kenny
to wit i have found nothing wrong with this remote place and i must admit it will be with some melancholy that i will leave this island and return homei saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too she had the nicest boobs everhumbly yours kenneth
in the timehonored traditions of our ancestors we honor the native hawaiian butters stotch with his hapa noa  the sharktooth necklace represents your connection to our island  now drink the chichi
whoa it's like gasoline
drink young keiki and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away
hey uh now i do feel butter uh better
o spirits of ancestors we ask that you bless this native hawaiian with his hapa noa we ask that you
listen  listen everyone i have terrible horrible news
do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa
i've just come from the front office the mahalo rewards card is
what what has happened speak
the mahalo rewards card is being eliminated they're trying to say our points are are no longer going to be accepted
i knew one day it would come to this
to what what does this mean
the haoles are trying to do away with us
with no rewards program there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't
why can't you people respect our island why do you always want nore
i'm sorry keiki your hapa noa will have to wait for we must unite together as never before it is time to show the haoles that this is our island
stop ruining our island haoles fire
what are they doing
take a swing let them know they are not welcome
i've never done this before
it's all right just try to tap into that anger that's inside you
aim my anger stupid  ben affleck  waaah
hold on  hold on
oh i can't i can't i can't hold on
i love you i love you
no i love you i love you back
this is breaking news
an insurrection in the hawaiian islands has escalated to war after sinking a cruise ship the natives of kauai continue to go berserk forcing all tourists off their island
they just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore
then a little boy called me a skank
the president says he will send the coast guard to take the island back though he sympathizes being a native hawaiian himself  hm
are all the tourists gone from our island
all but a few who are hiding out at duke's restaurant we sent bob and trisha turner to smoke them out
what about him
what about me
he's a tourist and he knows everything we have to kill him
no kenny's my friend he's the only kid at school i actually like you buncha jerks
be careful young keiki your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony perhaps we should finish it now
finish his ceremony we are at war david i have lived on this island for ten years ten years every july and part of august and i can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide
he's right david we can't trust any tourists
he won't betray us will you kenny
no i'm not going to fucking betray anybody
then let him prove himself trial by opahika'a
he's only a child
if he wants to be one of us then he must face the challenge
very well
this isn't right he's not a native he's gonna get killed
kenny be careful
quiet he must face this challenge alone
by the gods perhaps he has the heart of a native after all
he still has yet to make the turn
hohhh
that's pretty good
whoops
kenny
awwwww
i told you a haole couldn't do it
did you make the turn your first try did any of us
don't worry butters your friend will find a way back to his kind the gods will protect him
we have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war all the native hawaiian tribes must join as one
we're not joining the people of the hyatt grand vacations they have no rights to call themselves natives
oh and you do your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago our ancestors sailed here on a cruise ship nine months ago
look if we are to fight the haoles we have to allow all natives to say
it doesn't matter how many tribes we have we can't win we are but a few against the haole's military might we may have passion but passion does not win wars
oh no come up here keiki come on  this child sunk a cruise ship by himself tell them keiki
well i don't know about the rest of ya but i'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time i came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony and i can't even have it 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything
yeah
screw them
well if you ask me the only good haole is a dead haole with a with a stick up his butthole and his wiener cut off rraahhhh
let us make a pact with more chichis
um we're we're out of chichis
oh right we've closed off all the ports
but they're still letting vodka through right uh they can't cut off our chichis
oh my god
this is the us coast guard we have instructions to take you by force if necessary
ready fire
fire
arm the bocce balls
god damn it
keep fighting stand your ground
we can't fight without chichis
you can and you must
stupid greedy haoles kill them all
come on come on  you know what chichis are right
listen everyone we gave it all we had it's over we must go down to nowiliwili harbor and surrender to the american government
surrender no the heck with that
we can't hold out here any longer
well i won't do it you hear me i'm not licking anybody's testes
young keiki try to control your anger
no this is our home and i'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks and just 'cause even after massacring daredevil they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes you shouldn't be able to be goodlooking and be with jennifer lopez and be a good director  all right all right fine argo is a good movie there i admitted it i told people that it didn't hold up but it holds up god darn it ben affleck has everything gragh
everyone look i say
the haole did it
my dear friends of the mainlandwhat adventures i have found on the tiny island of kava'i i have truly become one with the natives who found new courage to fight their oppressors
we are not surrendering today go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end
you people just don't give up do ya
the american government finally gave in to the natives and had the mahalo rewards cards reinstated our two cultures it appears will once again live in peace
with the war at an end our butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony and with any help from the gods become his old cheery self again
and so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa take your cards boys  apuiloa hapnanoaha hapa'a'a hohaaa  it's finally over young keiki is your anger at rest
yeah i guess so except it still doesn't change the fact that ben affleck gets to be handsome talented and then gets to go home and kiss jennifer lopez
ben affleck isn't with jennifer lopez anymore he's married to jennifer gardner
yeah it's true uh huh
what really but i thought i was totally jealous of him he's just married to jennifer gardner oh my god i feel so much better
you do
yeah ogh i like that ben affleck guy he's a good filmmaker come on kenny i guess i owe the kids at school an apology  did you see argo kenny it's a pretty good movie ben affleck has a lot goin' for him not everything but a lot whoopie

oh i feel like such an idiot
it's all right dad
but i wore that wristband everywhere and the guy's a complete phoney  there's even more coming out about it today
these latest tests are once again confirming that the performanceenhancing drug hgh was in the body of christ at the time of crucifixion all over the country people are having their what would jesus do wristbands cut off it was just last week a team of scientists found traces of hgh on the shroud of turin   along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers
without a doubt there was uh hgh in the body of christ at the time of crucifixion jesus did not suffer for our sins he was in fact very high
all the years of being told somethin' it's just so unfair
priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove jesus from the record books and from the last supper
i know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets i bet they all feel pretty stupid now
yeah and so and so then i asked preacher well what about the new testament
uh huh
and he says well you still should oughta read it but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to jesus' name whenever it comes up
so weak dude dark times brah dark times  dude what the hell you're wearing a what would jesus do bracelet
all right all right i got it a few weeks ago big whoop
the big whoop isn't that you have one the big whoop is that you're still wearing it
yeah stan didn't you hear jesus did all his miracles on drugs
yeah i know
well don't you care jesus asterisk christ stan people are feeling really cheated by all this
wuughhhuh where do i go what do i do
cartman's right if you care about fairness stan then you really have to lose the bracelet
look i just don't want to you guys honestly it's not that big a deal
it's the charlie rose show here's chuck
we are here tonight with the only person in america who still wears his what would jesus do wristband please welcome stan marsh
dick
stan after everything that's come out after all the facts have been proven why do you still wear the wristband
i don't know  i just like it
you just like it
yeah i donno i've had it a long time i just don't feel like cutting it off
well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their what would jesus do wristband is doing all of society a disservice chris martin you say that stan marsh is a dick
yeah yeah thanks charlie my problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth okay if jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs that's fine but then he went on to say it was a miracle and that is where it became dangerous what about the incas what about the aztecs millions of people who were murdered in jesus's name and then jesus turns out to be a fraud wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone
what do you say about that stan
i don't know  i like it
all right well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with stan marsh and thinks he's doing the right thing please welcome a retarded fish  now retarded fish you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet
that that's because that's because you're a retarded fish and you don't know any better what about the crusades the inquisitions how many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake
what about the crusades stan soes that enter into your decision at all
no i just i don' know no
anything to add retarded fish
nnno no i'm good thank you
stan hey stan can i talk to you  listen stan ah i just wanna tell you you've really been an inspiration m'kay
i have
yeah you know i can't believe in jesus anymore 'cause he's a damned fraud so what i'm gonna believe in is just bein' me and bein' independent like you so what i did is i got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground uhkay and just believin' in the cause of bein' me
you're wearing a bracelet to think of me
oh i'm not the only one there's lost of people doin' it  hey butters stand ground
stand ground mr mackey
anyway thanks stan and you know just keep on keep on standing your ground okay
you're wearing a brown bracelet butters
well yeah  it helps remind me that i shouldn't back down anymore when i feel pressure from other people i just got really moved when i saw what did for all those farmers in belarus
farmers in where
move aside farmers this land is no longer yours
we will not move aside we will stand our ground  like the child on the charlie rose show
dude where are people getting all the brown wristbands
i donno i got mine down at   see right here
hello you interested in the stanground bracelehoh wow it's you  stanground brah
wow this is happening so fast
hello stan steve nelson with endorsement management are you ready for your nike commercial

hey you wanna siddown
i'm good
sir the captain has asked everyone to take their seats
tell the captain to take off  people ask me you never took the bracelet off not once  no never not ever  what do i do i stan ground
now when dr drew told jeff conway he was on a oneway street to nowhere what tactics did he use to try and convince
mr marsh if you don't mine we'd like to see your bracelet
for what
if you have nothing to hide then please hand it over mr marsh
what are you people talking about
are we good we live tom i'm here at south park elementary where officials have barged their way in after reports of stan marsh of the stanground foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet rumors have surfaced that stan did not stan his ground as previously stated and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together
please let us check your wristband for superglue
no this is stupid
he's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that why don't you leave him alone
are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet mr marsh
no i never cut if off
then let us ahsee it
this is an outrage who out there is saying that our friend stan is a liar
i cannot say but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige
who
all right it was craig
craig you asshole
what's the big idea craig
it just looked like you cut it off that's all
you got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down you can't just say anything you want about people
ooo look at him go stanning his ground
yeah
you know what happens when you lie craig you hold that lie inside
go stan
and it grows and it grows right in your balls until they have to cut it out
a little unnecessary but go stan
go ahead and test it then let's just see what happens to this moneyhungry alcoholic prostitute
yeah
prostitute
this is breaking news
the tests are done and the results are in the little boy who claimed he never cut off his what would jesus do bracelet did cut it off and lied about it
not only did we find traces of ahsuperglue but of yellow magic ahmarkeur as well this is a dark ahday for honest frenchswedish people everywheure
though the tests seem conclusive stan marsh continues to deny any cheating
yeah
hey dude people are kind of pissed off at you
thanks kyle
you probably should come clean and tell the truth did you superglue your bracelet
why does it matter
because you kind of made it matter
you know i'm just i'm just through with this whole thing i just i can't put my family through any more of this
sso you did superglue it
ugh you know what's really sad that this is what matters to people what nobody seems to remember are the farmers in belarus stanground is bigger than me you wanna tell all those farmers in belarus it's all bullcrap
dude the sooner you eat your peas the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back eh ya you need to bill clinton this
you really think i went through all that trouble lying about my wristband and claiming to be something i wasn't for what kyle for what  this is a witch hunt dude it's all that stupid french scientist he's the fraud and i'm gonna prove it

maybe if we could get people to care about it then i could go and save it and people would be stoked on me again
how can we raise awareness
we need to get some bracelets
welcome welcome to the pf pityef bracelet factory how can i be of service
well we wanted to start a new movement and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets
ah i see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already delightful what color would you like your new scause to be
our scause
well of course you came for a scause to wear on your paws and you want others to wear yours upon thaurs
i'm confused
hm perhaps i should start from the beginning in the modern age there are those who believethat a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve and so we sell a cause it's called a scauseand wearing a scause gets you lots of applause we start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpistthen dip it in colors that show off your purposethere are green scauses for recycling blue scauses for kitties and pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties do you hate abortion ah then a white scause is for you why not champion your scause with some sparkles and gluewe make scauses for this we make scauses for that why there's even a scause for just being fat what's the matter can't think of a scause how about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozzlet's just think of the thing that you care about most then let's make it orange like marmalade toastand now i'd like to say thank you for your coming downi'm off to go sell these in your little town

hey stan well some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along that that you you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the belarusian farmers
people are saying that
yeeah is it true
wow you know whatever it takes butters people are aware of the problems in belarus maybe i did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence
heyah whatever stan yeah i thought you were a butthole  but nnow i think you're a good sneaky little butthole
we did it
it has become the biggest concern for most people the farmers of belarus and their plight against their government and now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis his name jesus
these are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives you know i'm uh ahi'm here just to do whatever i can
jesus some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use
you know ah i don't even have time to think about that this is a crisis that needs my attention and i'm just here to do whatever i can i've talked to the government here and i've talked to the farmers and i think we have everything just about worked out
aaaah
you know whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me it doesn't change the fact that the people of belarrus need my help
ah i believe it's belarus jesus
yes it very well may be if we don't do something now
um so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating is that right
i'm just doing what i've always done people wanna know what i'm on what am i on i'm on a farm in belarrus busting my ass what are you on

oh my it's the sound
wuwhat sound
of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound  that's the sound that means i must pack up my tent it's the sound of the last cent being spent  my work here is done and just look at you now you're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow enjoy all your scauses you look great in your cause be sure to give each other lots of applause i'm off to the next town in my little truck have a nice day toot a loo
fuck dude weak
it's almost like like that guy had this figured out all along
yeah
we were trying to do good but we got everyone duped by a bracelet company
yeah well i guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us
well we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money
what can we possibly do
what would jesus do  yeheah
vengeance is mine
no please please show mercy
get out
thank you my children  we've all been through a lot we got caught up in scauses that didn't mean squat they turned my message away from the teachings it hid and made it about me and the things that i did which of course i didn't do and even if i did use performanceenhancing drugs so did all the other prophets but i didn't so what have we learned from this great wristband theft maybe that when stripped of our scauses only causes are left and causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer let's keep our causes where they belong which is  right here on tshirts  free pussy riot
free pussy riot
yeah

what if i did kyle
chr what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election
pretty sweet huh

i don't believe it
no really there are states full of swingers bunch of perverts if you ask me
why do you have these
funny how voting works in this country isn't it kyle  each one of these a person someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard
dude
here's another patriotic american he probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate
knock it off cartman
now believe it or not kyle i actually need your help but first you have to promise not to tell anyone

let's just see
ey you can't do that ey
upstairs first door to the left
i know my rights stop right now

i was always told that we lived in a country based on freedom that the one thing that made america different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted but it's all changing isn't it ever since obama was first elected it's all changing
oh my god what have we done
guess this country is changing we're sorry little boy we're so sorry

guys you guys  listen cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere he's changed the outcome of the election
wow really that's pretty impressive
come on guys he's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them
but i thought obama won pretty easily last night
dude because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter
i don't understand that stuff at all i need morgan freeman to explain it to me
yeah i love when morgan freeman explains stuff
whenever i'm confused about what's going on in a movie i'm always so relieved when morgan freeman shows up and explains the plot to me
god damn it this is serious you guys cartman has stolen the election
well mmmaybe cartman had a good reason
butters you know something don't you
huh wha no uhuh why

red lobster
red lobster
oh red lobster
general tso do you have the missing ballots or not
sssure we have the ballots but we don't have them right here with us now
okay you want me to come in again we can start over what the fuck is this
all right where are the missing ballots  president obama
oh god damn it kyle i was just about to get what i wanted
mr president we got you reelected now you will give us the star wars technology so that we can make the sequels
i told you china would get the rights to star wars from disney as long as my presidency was secure  until i have those ballots  it is not secure
wait a minute the rights to star wars the movies what the hell is going on here
what's going on is the sale of america's greatest asset  you see when the united states created star wars it made this country incredibly powerful
morgan freeman
earlier this week lucas signed the rights to star wars over to disney and the chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves the chinese government knew that president obama would help them take the rights from disney if they helped him get reelected
ohhhh
but the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met you've all got quite a mess on your hands i wish you well with it
hey just one thing morgan freeman  how come every time something convoluted needs explaining you show up
because every time i show up and explain something i earn a freckle
so here's the deal general tso mr president when the chinese make the sequels i get to play the part of luke skywalker's son cartman skywalker
that was not the deal we will not be abullied by you
well then i guess we're about to play a game of chicken general tso
heheh i get it general tso's chihchihchicken
you are absolutely sure about this
it's been confirmed mike my god we might have won this thing
sir sir we have some incredible news there are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots you might have won the election after all
there's nothing here kyle
anything in the basement jimmy
just old junk and boxes of eric's mom's ddildos
well keep looking
oh my goodness what's going on
sorry ms cartman but your son took some things that didn't belong to him
oh i've told him to respect people's property what did he take
he stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected president
oh well no tv for him for a few days
there's nothing here kyle not even one ssscooby clue
oh my god you guys look  dude it's boba fett's ship
just what the dickens is going on here haha
aw shit it's him again
what's this about a deal with the chinese i own all this shit now i own the death star i own tatooine it's all mine haha all right fuckers where are the missing ballots haha
butters  you just couldn't keep your mouth shut could you butters
i didn't say anything i promise
i guess we learned that when it comes to star wars we can't trust anyone not the president not the chinese and not you
please eric i tried to be quiet i swear
shhh it's okay butters  nobody's gonna find the election ballots  i have them hidden away somewhere nobody would ever look  a place in town people barely even know exists
hey guys lookin' to buy a hummer today  we're havin' a rocktober sales event day that's goin' into rockvember  hey there interested in testdrivin' a hummer today  i can see you with the raybans got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down whattaya think  rockvember sales event guys every hummer comes with a free segway
hey why don't you shut up
i'm just excited about all these deals that's all
we found him sir but still no sign of the missing ballots
go on leave us alone haha  now listen little boy the reason this country works is because people go out to vote every vote counts and you need
cut the crap mouse you only care about the election results because romney would have been tougher on the chinese
why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are it will make your death a lot less painful haha
trust me they're somewhere nobody will ever find them if you kill me then obama will stay president and you will lose star wars to the chinese forever
pretty neat huh how would you like to have one
i can get those at kmart if you want me to switch sides you'll have to do better than that
like what
i want a part in the new movies
well then why didn't you just come to me in the first place if you wanna be in the next star wars i'm your guy haha
i get to be luke skeywalker's son and there has to be a character called jewbacca
you can be luke's son you can be han solo's son i don't give two shits and a popsicle
really well then i suppose that making the votes public is the right thing to do i can get the ballots for you but if i'm gonna smuggle them here i'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun
sure thing i've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole haha
haha
haha
haha
this is breaking election news hold that phone the election may be over but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for mitt romney were stolen
we need everyone's help here what you're looking for are big boxes of ballots hundreds of them please check your basement your attic and
and and you claim that a general tso hired your friend fatass to steal the ballots but so far the chinese are refusing to speak with us
yeah probably 'cause general tso's chicken
is that it did he just did he just
yup chris we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time
excitement and revelry at south park as a little boy has just made the general tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time
what
little boy the general tso's chicken joke a favorite for years you've just hit the magic number how does it feel
i what
he's being presented with the check now a five thousand dollar gift certificate to pf chang's  this has been a long campaign but someone's finally done it wolf
well we tried dude
it just seems so unfair people won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the white house
well i mean look at it this way almost half the country did actually vote for obama if the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes cartman stole then does it matter that much
it matters stan it it matters
ho ho ho hoo  come on down to stevenson hummer for our big christmas in humvember sale  not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season why not give them a nice hummer nothing beats a hummer on christmas morning
stan when was the last time you saw somebody drive a hummer
uhhh forever ago like
oh my god
hey looking for a hummer today got some s here never been driven ever  go on get out of here shoo
look there they are
hey hi there you kids like hummers huh let me show you these babies
we found it you guys  oh no they followed us
oh hell yes asians hey guys
get out of our way
no these don't belong to you they belong to the people
i am tired of playing games this little farce is ovah
i don't think so general tso this way officers
oh my god it's a sales rush
oh my god are those what i think they are
yes we must show these to the public for democracy's sake right kyle
sir we've found something at the hummer sales lot outside of town
you don't understand we are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made
protect it
what the hell is going on here
perhaps i can explain it to you  you see it turns out the only reason the chinese so desperately wanted star wars is because they're afraid that disney might not be the right place for it the chinese simply want to guard star wars' impeccable legacy
is that morgan freeman
and now we're at a crossroads if these ballots are made public then the man the people voted for will be president but he will no doubt keep star wars from the chinese and allow disney to keep it instead and so we have to ask ourselves what's more important that the right man is elected president or that star wars is with people who will protect it most
unit  what is it over
well kid
well if you put it that way
come in unite  what have you found
nothing sir we just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants that's all barkley out
no but obama wasn't really elected don't you people care
obama is president again

yeah we've heard of that we've also heard of the declaration of independence see there's a lot of people out there who think like you people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the emails of its citizens that is until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life you wanna live in the land of the free and the home of the brave but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that american flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the starspangled montezuma's revenge there's one thing icanguarantee you
yeah what's that
you won't care who's checkin' your twitter account then
i never thought of it that way
hey phillip pull my fingeraaaahahahaha
hello craig how would you like to know the truth
the truth about what
we're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart
aahhhh no i don't think so
my colleague and i we went to saaah experience at dmv we went to dmv we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart
okay
you see craig once i came clean with the government i no longer had anything to hide then i found peace have you read any dmv literature
aaaaaaaaaaaahh no
well there's a lot of interesting stuff in here craig there's even some quotes from president obamacould you read this part out lout
your local dmv is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient
yeah whattaya think president obama means when he says that
i have no idea
wellwebelieve that he means the government loves you and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart
yes sirsee i used to be like you i go around sending them nasty emails and a nasty texts puttin' nasty picture on my nasty facebook but then i realized all these things they live forever because the government keep a file on us so all that live forever up in what they call the clou' it's a government term if they could put a file in the clou' then i wanna make sure i come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the clou' because we all live forever in the clou'
uh huhdid you follow all that craiguh i don't think i really followed all that
what is that voice
some little faggot in my head
hey so um as i'm going through people's emails and phone calls um how do i know which people to start with
pretty simple everyone has a file people who have a status of threat possible threat or person of interest are the ones we really wanna look at
the more we pay attention to them the bigger their file becomes
really how big is my file
huh
uhh that us uhh yoyou must have a pretty big file on eric cartman all his blogs and emails have been watched for quite some time
jarvis what have we got on an eric cartman any files on eric cartman
ohhh yeah we tracked him for a little bit but central computer designated his status as fat and unimportant
uhh trust me he's not fat and unimportant i think we need to change his status to ripped and sweet'scuse me excuse me there's a very important threat to national security we need to change eric cartman's status
and that's when i masturbated togame of thrones i know it was wrong to masturbate and i know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty
what thewhy do these people keep coming here
but i am done forever withgame of thrones forever
next please
thank you
yaaaaaay
congratulations brother how do you feel
i i feel really good
heehhhhhhhah
wow those people over there seem like they're havin' fun
i can't think of anywhere i'd rather be than at the dmv with all you wonderful people now let's all pledge allegiancei pledge allegiance
to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
what the hell is going on here this is the dmv there will be no joy here
uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong
hey i'm just trying to renew my license how much longer do i gotta wait
shut up sit there and wait and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously i'll put a stop to this
look i am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake eric cartman is the nsa's worst nightmare
not according to the central computer
the central computer is wrong you need to change his status
sorrybut if central computer says he is not a threat then we can't do anything
can't do anything you're the nsa
there's  million people out there how do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country how do you think we're able to really know who's doing what
i don't know
alright i'll show you but this is very top security stuff because if people knew how we did it then everyone would do it then our enemies would do it we can't let our enemies get their hands on this
get their hands on whatdude
this is how we know who's a threat and who's not how we know who's sleeping and who's awake how we know that
you think i'm fat and unimportant nowi am eric cartman and i've got news for you this is all being broadcast live on my twitter zeppelin and on alec baldwin's new television show via shitter
hi everybody and welcome to my new show on msnbc free pass with alec baldwin
you should have taken me out when you had the chance now everyone knows the truth and everyone's gonna think i'm superkewl
eric honey what's the matter
it didn't work mom i infiltrated the nsa and i was a whistleblower and i thought everyone would be superpissed off at what exposed about the government but nobody cared nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything nobody cares if santa claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine
i know that the nsa is torturing santa sweetie but they're keeping us safe
well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse
honey it's okay
it's not gonna be okay because now i'm a whistleblower and against my conscience i'm gonna have to hide out in russiaaaa
no you don't have to fly to russia hon
i do toooo
no it will be fine how about i make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine
okaaayi just want hot tea and codeine no lemon
okay hon
hello how would you like to know the truth
the fuck are you talking about butters
it's time to let go eric don't you see there's no other way just let the government into your heart
it's too late for me butters i have to go to russia and live with the commie dwarfs
it's never too late there's a place where you can start over
what's this
your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes
i can be forgiven
yes
for everything bad i've ever done
yes
and then all i have to do is go back to this place every time i do something wrong and admit it and i'm forgiven again
that's right
thta's pretty kewl
we've got a new member today eric cartman do you love your country
i do i love my country
do you pledge allegiance to the flag
i pledge it i pledge the fucking allegiance
hallelujah
yaaaaay
do you want us to kick them out of here lar
no no leave them alone it's a nice change to see people happy here at the dmvperhaps we here at the dmv can start changing as well perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope why the dmv can be a place where people come to get things off their chests confess yes but also be told that they're worth something in this world and then dmvs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe and when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness don't you see what this could lead to don't you see what we could become
the dmv was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boysthe heads of the dmv were arrested and the director stated quote hey it came with the territory with the dmv shut down americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post officewe've just received word that the us postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys it now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station wmz news will be back in a young boy

my report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television fellow students there is a plague of smut on our cable boxesshows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicidei'm talking of course aboutmurder porn
murder porn
that's more like it
according to the nielsen ratings viewership in shows like cold case files dateline murder and deadly affairs is skyrocketing amongst married couples the increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex and innuendo to make spousal murder more titillating shows like southern fried homicide sinful secrets on the case with paula zahn and it's all smut and it's garbage and it'strashyour parents are watching this stuff go home and ask them and as we ask them we must also ask ourselves if they're obsessed with this stuff then how long how long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes mommy's head in with a brick
oh crap who could that be oh it's it's probably fuckin' stan ah hang on a second budcome on itoh hey stan what's up
his wife is having sex with the neighborand when her husband comes homehe wants more than just a divorce
you guys are watchin' murder porn
murder porn stan this is just an investigative crime show
uh adults like documentaries
yes stan these are based on real things this is like news it's informative parents like informative stuff
okaaay
oh we missed the murder did he cut them up
what's up dude
dude do you know aaron hagen
yhh yeah the first grader
you should come down to his house his dad just killed his mom
what
hey that kid should not be seeing this
what happened
you're making a mistakelet me go it wasn't me i tell ya a burglar broke in he was black he's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face he was blaaack
guys guys i know we're all concerned but we have to work together
how is this stuff allowed to stay on the air
the police found hours and hours of murder porn on the hagens' dvr what more proof do we need
i called the networks that are putting this smut out there and you know what they told me they told me if i didn't want my parents watchin' then i should spend more time with them like it'smyfault
this is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals
boooooooooo boooo wendy testaburger boo
look everybody i know we all feel our hands are tied but the fact is wecando something about this there's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television and it is passwordprotected with a security code that only a child would know
tonight at  it's a tale of lust seduction and murder on sexy betrayalsthen at  some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuitson southern fried homicide but now get ready for lust betrayal and murderon hot load case files
oh yeahthree of the best shows in a row
is the lube over there
yeah i got lube right here
well get over here big guy
yeahhah
what thewhat the hellyeah hi uhh we aren't getting our informative murder porn no no none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working yeah the screen just says how do you tame a horse in minecraft uhhh yes we do have children a what a parental lock
stan stanhow do you tame a horse in minecraft
what
what is minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it
you guys don't need to be watching that stuff
oh come on you can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn what you you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it that's stupidi'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because i watch investigate discovery stan it'd be impossible to clear away all the dna evidence anyway even if i hired someone else to kill her i'd have to kill that person too because  of the time that person eventually tells the truth i thought this through a lotstanyou're a lousy kid i wish jaden smith was my son
who do out children think they are blocking our tv content
how are they able to do this with their smartphones
it's all right our kids think they've outsmarted us but we're the ones who pay the cable companywhat'd they say can they remove the parental lock
no they just did their usual cablecompany runaround
what we'll see about thisexcuse me our content is being blocked and we need it now
i'm sorry sir if you need it now perhaps you should switch to another cable companyohhh there's not another cable company is thereohhh that's right we're the only one in town
look if our kids can block content then you must be able to block them
as we told the others sir we can fix it we just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box
oh well okay great
we'll just need to find a window of time you can be home how about between the hours of  am and  pm all of november
no i can't wait around my house from  am to  pm all of november
oh you can'tjeez that's too bad you need to be home for the technician have you thought of switching to directv
i can't afford directv
oh you can'tjeez that's terrible then i guess you just have to work within our time windows
well any luck
no just the usual cablecompany stuff
oh well guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama
no screw that can't we just learn this minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock
i've tried it's not like other video games i really don't get it it was all retro and like legos but then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off

i spent three hours last night trying to get tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle when i finally got away from them i found they had taken all my dandelions
why did we agree to that stupid app
you know why because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn
and why was that because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom for all we know that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it
i have to agree with cartman maybe we overreacted when our parents
boooooo boo wendy boooo
it's true dude maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see
all right that's enough come on out and there won't be any troublegive it up stotch you've nowhere to run
huh
i'll never give up i don't even remember doing thisjust leave me alone

aha
oh shit
i knew you're up to something
son of a bitchdon't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff
kids gotta find some way to make a livin' don't 'e
you have no idea what this is about do you we were using minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows
what you mean like investigation discovery

yeah i've seen that stuff'oo the bleep did i marry true crime with aphrodite jones real sick shit your parents watch that stuff
we put a stop to it until you taught them minecraft
your problem ain't with me mates sure one or two people might act out what they see in video games but cable televisionpeople copy everything they see people do on cable you're goin' about this all wrong you wanna protect your family you're gonna have to go fight the cable company
hey guys can i help you
hello there are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families and we want them removed please
ohhh you don't want cable anymore
no no just ivy network ae oxygen and oprah's network all the ones with murder porn
you don't like paying for all the channelsohh our company actually packages channels together
look can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want
oh i'm sorry our company doesn't work that wayyou want me to give you the number of a different cable company that canoh wait we're it aren't wedangit i guess you have to deal with our packages
can we talk to your supervisor please
oh sure hey david
hi is there a problem here
we want specific networks dropped from our cable
ohhh you have to pay for the bundle you can't just pay for what you wanna watch darn it
you mean that we're forced to pay for the oprah channel
i guess if you don't wanna beforced to pay for oprah you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether
finethen we'll shut our cable off altogether
hey mitch when can you get out to shut off some cable boxes
oh man it's gonna be like three weeks there's a whole plug i have to pull out it's like four inches long
three weeks huh okay is three weeks from now okay with you guys
no that's way too long
oh it is
oh jeez that's terrible
goddammit i just don't want my parents to murder each othercan't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe look ah i don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch all we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them because cable makes is so convenient sure if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels they'd be bummed out but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want is it
say say that last part again
what
well what was the last part you said
i said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want
nono the part about your parents not getting the channels easily
i said it would really bum them out
howhow much would it bum them out
ladies and gentlemen please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company
hello in an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming customers still wishing to view truecrime networks will now need to purchase a separate packagewhich will require a technician to service your cable box every night from  to  am and must include the purchase of  channels in portuguese we realize this may be an inconvenience to you and we hope you will voice all your concerns to us because at your local cable company the customer is always our bitch
jaden smith lets his parents do whatever they want you know what the guys at work they took a bet on who would win in a fight you or jaden smith and they all said jaden smith could kick your ass he does movies and he can sing and he's totally cool to his parents

the government is looking for a patient zero going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airportanyone with information regarding patient zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately
holy moly
can i help you
stay by the window tell me if anything changes  i need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance
alright you want a rifle  well like this  caliber  what is it you intend to shoot
a person
you mean a person who's threatening you
threatening all of us
please please hurry it's important
well you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you
what how am i supposed to get a person to break into my house
you can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street well unless of course you're in a state that has a stand your ground law
stand my ground
please we're running out of time
see now with a stand your ground law you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not
yes yes that's what i need i'll take that
no no see you've gotta be in a state with a stand your ground law like florida
this is hopeless how am i supposed to shoot token with all these stupid rules  wait a minute i can't shoot token  but i can shoot anyone i want in florida
so long as they're threatening you
what what is it please hurry my husband might still be alive
the other way to stop the outbreak token isn't the only patient zero the outbreak won't happen if we shoot george zimmerman we have to get to florida
let's go let's go let's move move move move let's go
this plane is going to baltimore
if we don't get to florida there's not going to be a baltimore left  black guy in the back  alight now let's find zimmerman
put this on we have to stay hidden from here out
what are we going to do
i'm going to flush out patient zero and you're gonna shoot him it's the only way
what if he attacks us first
don't worry nobody can see us wearing black
i haven't had the time to thank you for doing what you've d
eat your breakfast girls
where's daddy
you can eat without your father in the room now hurry

good morning girls  save daddy any pancakes look at that six am and my family is already smiling
how did i get such a perfect husband geroge zimmerman
and how did i get such a beautiful wife
i love you dad
i love you too princess i love both of you equally
nothing can ever go wrong so long as we all have each other
is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse  cnn has just received word that the government has learned the identity of patient zero  the nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down and measures are being taken to stop him
daddy what's a patient zero
hello mr zimmerman your country needs you
what do you need from me
we  need you to shoot a young africanamerican for us
i gave that up
you're the best zimmerman we just need you to do it one more time for the security of the world

then do it for your family  this is about protecting people zimmerman keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out
something's wrong  look out

that may be true but i'll have to live with this the rest of my life even though i'll be walking around a free man
hey wait a minute this kid isn't black he's white
wait what
guilty
the zombie apocalypse is over all the panic crashing planes and chaos appear to have for some reason died with george zimmerman and as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down  although he survived the shooting his wishes are to remain anonymous giving the hospital only the nickname brad pitt but cooler
that sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse
yeah that sucked
well at least i'll bet token's glad it's over with aren't you token

south park themegoth kids  dawn of the posers lyrics
so i cast my body into the trails of bloodthe knife pierces deep deep into my lonely eyesso i can see this black world no more
whoa that's pretty hardcore
that's real pain right there
that's how i feel when my mother abuses me i just wanna escape to she can't hurt me anymore
henrietta sweetie
shut up mom go away
oh but remember daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room my dark little princess
stop calling me a princess i'm not a beauty queen in a disney movie
we'll be waiting in the living room
god she justnever stops
oh goodness i am so nervous
what
have a seat henrietta
oh a little family chitchaaat
shut up mom
henrietta as you know your mother and i have been concerned about your behavior for some time
are we really doing this again
we've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into but we've finally had some counseling and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is emo
what
but daddy and iloveour little muffin even if she's emo or not
i'm not a fucking emo don't you even know the fucking diff
do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart
like calling mommy demon jizz
so listen sweetie we've found a camp
noo
a camp which is for troubled kids like you and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility
i'm not going to any fucking camp
it's for two weeks and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges
i won't come back because i'll be fucking dead i'll walk out of that camp and i'll walk the streets until i probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until i'm bleeding out my fucking eyes
theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes
and that's all you know what else did she say
she said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks
oh my god for two weeks
is she at the camp now
i don't knowshe texted from the bus they put her on then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going then all of a sudden her texts went dark
whoa
that's fucking creepy man
i just can't believe it i can't believe parents would do that to their child
alright now you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents
yes they called her an emo
what's wrong with that
emos suck their vile selfpitying depressed assholes
so why do you think they called her that
because she's goth and some ignorant people don't know the difference
whatisthe difference
oh my god they're totally different
okay different how
they're achm you know one is good and an' emos are horribleyou're you know they're posers
emos suck my goth balls
alright alright think of it this way a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up but anemothinks that deep downtheyare totally fucked up
that's not much of a difference
that's a huge fucking difference
okay okay look emos are more prone to suicide
this fuckin' bitch man
but goths are more prone to be depressed that so many peoplecommitsuicide
goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas emo's is cynical
wait i thoughtwewere cynical what what whatever it doesn't matter
no see you're nihilistic
oh yeah you're right
hello somebody let me out of here you can't treat people like thisthis is fucking ridiculous what's wrong with you i'm gonna go to the fucking cops when i get out of here
what if she comes back and she's all preppy and conformist
she's only been there two weeks they can't have changed her that much can they have
oh my god
hey guys
what the hell have they done to you
what do you mean they couldn't do anything they can't fix me they don't even understand me
oh my god it's worse than we thought they made heremo
has she said one word to either one of you guys
nothing it's like she's a totally different person
she won't even look at us all she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids
god pe class is for such wannabe posers
i'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts
i wish there would just be an earthquake so we could alldie
uugh how could she hang out with them
there must something else going on here
not now mom i'm suicidal
it's not your mom it's me
oh hey
what did they do you you at that camp
what do you mean just the usual group therapy crap
don't take this the wrong way but i think that place turned you into an emo
that's ridiculous i'm not anything i don't fit in anywhere i'm not emo okay
then why are you listening to sunny day real estatei was thinking maybe they just made you confused at that place maybe they didn't know what they were doing but then i started thinking maybe that place turned you emo on purpose like maybe theyknewwhat they were doing
you should probably stop digging for answers
what
there's no winning this for yousoon the entire world will be emo it is our time
nooo waaaaay
nobody understands us and they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late

are you crazy
what choice do we have
the vampires are our sworn enemy we beat up their leader and burned down their lair don't you remember
yeah i remember and it may be a suicide mission but we have to walk right in the middle of the vampires and ask them for help
okay let's all be seated pleasethis is thee noon meeting of the vamp kids i am mike your lord and dark master per se
hail mike
okay uhhh our main order of business is of course the halloween social we're still looking for volunteers to make the

sorry
but uhhh we have a bigger problem here and it's all of our problem
you've got a lot of nerve coming here
now shut up mike listen okay there's a camp that kids like us are being sent to aand somehow this place is taking kids like us and turning them emoyeah you might not even be able to tell at first it could have already happened one of you might already be turned
okay hold up hold up you mean that one of us might not really be a vamp kid
uhhhhh right
well whoever you is you better get yo' ass ready to run muthafucka 'cause you're a damn traitor and i bet you it's this little nigga right here
are you guys getting into that fall out boy concert
i can't i'm too depressed i keep cutting myself

henrietta i baked cookies for your new little emo friends

we're emoswhen we rule the earth we're not gonna have football
oh yeah
and you say she just showed up like this
you know henrietta that thing in there is not henrietta
that blonde emo is sarah collins she was a vamp kid two weeks ago
you want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas i'll do it
we can't just go in there and kick their asses we have to stop this thing at its source
indeed if there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters then we will have to use our most powerful vampiric abilities to stop it
do you mean
yes my child of darkness we must call upon the powers of the vamp kids' most sacred entity per se only he can help us in this darkest time this calls for a summoning
we call upon the creator of all that is dark the godfather of death and despair edgar allan poe your followers in darkness beg for your helpwe summon to the world of the living the great edgar allan poe knower of all that is misery your children need special guidance per se
this is your plan try to summon edgar allan poe back from the dead
edgar allan poe was the original vamp kid
no he was the original goth but he'd been dead for  years
ey look man all genres of gothic subcultures are derivatives of poe's work muthafucka
look we came to you for help and all you've done since then is waste our time
holy shit look
where am i what is this place
it's him it's edgar allan poe
why have the living summoned me from my rest
uhhhhh okayokay listen there's this camp for troubled kids right only they aren't helping kids they're they're purposefully turning them into emos
emos ewoh my god emos are such wannabe conformists
yeah oh yes
right
children of darkness i would help you but i fear i cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey vamp kids and their poserass plastic fangs
thank you
hey
i'm just saying it's nice to know that edgar allan poe agrees wth us
agrees with who is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head poser
ah ah he got you there nigga
okay look we're running out of time you have to help us stop the emos

well yeah but see the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet
they can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off
i know that intellilink has had some hiccups uhkay but i've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the intellilink system and make sure it runs smoothly i want you all to meet pat conners

about what
i'm afraid that kyle and i got into a little disagreement yesterday yeah yeah it's pretty nasty and um i was totally wrong and you were right kyle i thought only humans could be gingers is davin here davin miller  oh yeah there you are i own an apology to you too davin when kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles i totally laughed in his face but it turns out kyle was right there are other animals that can be ginger as well i didn't believe it i guess i didn't want to believe it but this morning i saw a redhaired lightskinned cow and i owe you kyle and you davin my sincerest apology
where did you find a redhaired cow
oh would you would you guys like to see it
there there it is right there see a redheaded cow
whoa look at it
you were right kyle a ginger cow i shall never question your keen intellect again
wow that's pretty trippy
yes yeah be sure to get some pictures of it  i'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature
alright cartman joke's over
what what joke this is real
tell everyone you made the cow look like that
no  no you were right kyle i was wrong
boy eric i sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake
thank you butters
i gotta show this to my mom
let's go get the kindergartners uh they're gonna wanna see this too
yeah be sure to show everyone guys it's really amazing heheh too good too too good
even the dumbest lie can have big consequences
yes you're right kyle i'm sure that that is going to have earthshattering consequences heheheheh
your attention please will kyle broflovski report to the principal's office
huh
kyle broflovski to the principal's office please umkay
hohoh what'd you do kyle
nothing
busted
ah thanks for comin' kyle
wuwhat's going on
kyle these men have apparently come all the way from israel to speak with me but we need a translator
i don't speak hebrew
kyle please try your best it seems pretty important  this boy uhkay is jew uhkay jew like you uhkay please uh please try speak to jew
we're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business
anything
he said they come on urgent business
ohh what does he need
look we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people we wish to see the red cow
the red oh come on you can't possibly be here for that
for what what did he say kyle
please you must understand the fate of the world is at stake  the coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of judaism it signals the beginning of the end it is not just our religion but islam and christianity as well they all agree on one thing  that the red heifer means the end of times
you catch any of that kyle
it's right over here by uh
oh my holy shmear
the muslims they beat us here
what's goin' on kyle
he said the muslims beat them here  god damn it
step away you all know what this means
yes and you know you are about to die
hold on everybody this thing isn't even a
don't touch it
well i just ran to the school and told everyone hey there's a redheaded cow outside you should all see it
cartman stop you don't know what you're doing
i'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese which is like a swiss cheese except instead of holes it has freckles
noooo
the muslims and the christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war
very well let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends
alright so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles no shanks and no chemical weapons
if there can be no chemical weapons then the christians can use no nuclear weapons
come on without nuclear weapons what kind of final armageddon is this gonna be
but couldn't we agree on nonballistic nuclear weapons only
yeah i suppose that's fine
that makes sense
nonballistic nuclear only alright now on to prisoners are we all agreeing to decapitations
of course we are what do you think this is
yeah come on just get to it
wait a minute wait a minute has anyone noticed something we are all in a room together talking  has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy which amazingly is in all three religions could actually be meant to bring us together
the prophecy says the red heifer signals the end  could it mean the end of war
if the cow is sacrificed in israel according to the prophecy then perhaps it could bring about peace
after all the years of holy wars and hatred a possibility for peace in the middle east in the past  hours jews muslims and christians have met in israel to sort out their differences it may be a rocky road but many say the chance for peace is real and all because of a red cow discovered by a young boy here in the us we'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this
hey kyle yyou got a minute
yeah
i've gotta tell you something kyle the redheaded cow isn't real i made him up
no shit
i totally lied kyle and when you asked me if i had lied i looked you right in the eye and said no i owe you an apology and i mean it

no no kyle you said that it's never for the best remember that and you're right you're right kyle

hey kyle
hello stan
um dude we need to talk this has to stop
there are greater things at work than what you understand
if you wanna suck farts kyle that's fine go ahead but you can't suck farts and be a dick about it
i'm actually the complete opposite
all of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else
i'm not better i'm just doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place
see you sound like a dick
i happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own
dick that's a dick talking you've had too much of cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning and now you're a dick
all you need to know is i'm way awesomer than you think okay
i don't think kyle really loves cartman's farts there's something else going on
huh like what
this all started with the stupid peace in the middle east kenny for some reason it's making kyle crazy we've gotta get to the bottom of this
and now let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen eric cartman and his best friend fartboy
thank you everyone it's my honor to have been a part of this miracle isn't that right fartboy
could i please one of your pipinghot farts in my mouth
are you sure fartboy i've had a lot of strange food on this trip
yummy yummy i want your farts in my tummy
uh excuse me i'm sorry everyone but apparently there's some breaking news in the united states
we are in colorado where the red cow was discovered and apparently two boys have shocking news that might change everything
yes there's something that you all need to know the truth about the red cow we have all been  so sorry hang on  hello
dude do not do this
no dude you don't understand cartman hasn't been telling the truth
yes i know that why do you think i've been putting up with his farts
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
oh what
i know cartman made it all up okay i also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the middle east i'm okay with this stan
well i'm not okay with it 'cause it's turned you into a dick kyle
i'm not a dick i'm like gandhi
you know i don't think when gandhi starved himself he was all dude look how fuckin' awesome i am for starving check me out
okay okay stan you're right maybe i let being a martyr go to my head just please let me stay on this path and i'll try to be cool about it okay i'm sorry
you should apologize to kenny too
i'm sorry kenny
that's okay kyle
no what is the new information
the red cow i saw it too ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light it was a miracle
hurray
oh no it was a miracle
then it's not true the prophecy is not true
wait i thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow
no the prophecy is that one day a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky
i knew this was all too good to be true
we are associating with these heathens for no reason
small penis
the party's over muslims jews and christians are back at each other's throats and israel is once again a place of conflict and turmoil
please you have to listen to me the prophecy actually did come true
no it di'n't
yes it did
the prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger we should have known a prophecy like this was too impossible to ever come to be
but that is what happened it is tell them cartman
no kyle you were right i see now that little lies can cause huge problems
but it's the truth
no it's not kyle i have a huge dick
sorry boys but we've gotta get to our fight there's a rumble at the wailing wall  they leave and kyle turns around
ssso it was all for nothing the whole time i was eating farts for nothing
cheer up kyle i'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts hey how about we get a little dessert help cheer you up
the holiday season is here and black friday is upon us as you know black friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals last year  people died and  were seriously injuredthis winter the mall is offering  off to the first twenty people in the storefor you new recruits perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was likeor perhaps you thought workin' black friday wouldn't be a big deal
i'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash
or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into
that's enoughour only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together those of you who signed up are to be commendedbut i warn you do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doorswinter is coming
good evening sir i'm calling together all the fighters of zauron i need to speak with lady mccormick
she's not here right now
please tell her there is to be a meeting in the great hall i have found a way to get xbox ones and the fair lady mccormick will want to hear about it
thank you all for coming prince token sir timmy of blacklake lady mccormick warriors we have fought many great battles together at clyde's house at scott malkinson's house but soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives winter is coming and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves
which nobody can afford
what if i were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way wecanget the new gaming system
if you know of a way wizard then speak
i have learned of a dark magic at work the day after thanksgiving the first thirty people inside the mall get  off whatever they want they are calling it black friday
woo spooky
black friday come on that can't be real
itisreal craig i saw it on the news butthole
itisreal they do it every year but everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on black friday what chance do we have
on our own none but if we plan strategize and fight togetherwe can be the first people inside on black friday and use the  to get the gaming system we need to survive
well it's almost thanksgiving and we all know what that means
that's right black friday is right around the corner
ouch
and people are already gearing up
we usually start linin' up around  am we uh douse ourselves in pig blood because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open
we do it every year part of the family tradition last year we lost our youngest daughter he head was stepped on and crushed but in her memory we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year
if anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall and keep me from gettin'my kids christmas presents they can kiss my fat vagina 'cause i'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain
tom the south park mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year one thing's for sure people take black friday very seriously
yes yes very nice good
wizard cartman i have news from the internet my lord
they don't salute in game of thrones butters
uh sorry i haven't watched it yet
okay we need to start immediately pleaseah very good the house of greyhawk has agreed to join our fight
the house of greyhawk
larry and brad stoltsky
but my friends we must still find others who will fight by our side are there no other factions we can call to our aid
hey yeah i knowhow about we ask those kids who play star trek
uhh noo screw those guys they're dorks and i'm not playing with them
heythat's what i'm talkin' about you got any extra of thatoh thanksgets a little boring around here you know
enjoy the boredom while you can
so you worked here last winter you worked on black friday
i did
is it really as bad as they say it is
the shoppers hm they started showing up at midnight on thursday they didn't line up they just crammed themselves near the main entrance i can see their faces smooshed up against the glass licking their lips waiting to get in god the sounds that they made it was  am when they opened the doors there was screaming blood people tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background i saw a woman pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head before i knew it they were all around me fighting clawing then a hand reached in and pulled me out old cap he saved us all that daywhen it was over the front of the mall was covered in red bodies shopping bagsand now winter comes again
well wizard cartman i started watching game of thrones
ah yes paladin butters are you enjoying it
well it's it's pretty good i guess but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener that guy's character is gay
what do you mean
well ihit's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff but most times they show a man's wiener it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers
iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show paladin butters
yeah i know winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way i'm pretty excited for that just could do with a little less gay wiener is all
we have word from the kindergartners they've agreed to join us
those xbox ones are as good as ours
yeah
wait wait what are you talking about xbox ones
that's what this is all about craig we're all trying to get xbox ones on black friday
i thought we were getting playstation 's

nnnoo guys when i said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems i was obviously talking about xboxes
yeah
eh but i want a ps not a crappy xbox
look guys we all have to agree on one system
that's right
if some of us are on pss but the rest of us are on xbox's then we all can't play together online see this is all about committing to one machine
right let's all get pss
no the xbox's are gonna be better
they're not better they're just more expensive
we are getting xbox ones guys and that is final
that's exactly how xbox people are
yeah
fine if you guys don't wanna join us on black friday to get xboxes then that's fine
we're still gonna fight on black friday just not with you
oh it's gonna be like that is it
everyone who wants to get pss join with us
no we can't divide like thisstanyou're on our side right
i like the ps's controller better
stan the ps doesn't have the seamless transition between games movies and tv offered by xbox one
the ps has a touchpad interface you never listened i told you i thought the ps was better but you never wanted to listen to me kyle you just had your head so set becausebecause that's how xbox people are
then i guess i'll see you on black friday
if i see you at the mall kyle i will have to try to beat you inside
i know
come on kyle let these sony fucks wallow in their limited voicecontrol functionality
christmas is coming the goose is getting fatplease to put a penny in the old man's

bullshit
i did sharoni saw they were hiring extra security and i thought it'd be a good way to make money
you're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on black friday aren't you
nobody else has thought of it sharon i won't even be out in the crowd i'll be on the inside when the doors open while everyone is trying to run over each other i'll turn around and run right into the stores i'll be the first to get whatever i want

cheap xbox ones for real
the federation has agreed to fight with uswith them and the kindergartners our army has just doubled in sizeyou still think you can convince stan to come back to our side don't you sir kyle
i don't know
you can't change his mind sir kyle sony people don't think with logic he betrayed us and now we must outgame of throneshim by making powerful alliances
oh don't even get me started i keep watchin' that show and i'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and and kick everyone's butt but all i get is wiener wiener wiener it's not all gay wiener but when they do show a straight guy's wiener it's all soft and floppy even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl why is that because a soft wiener isn't threatening just like a gay wiener
butters you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners
i'm obsessed with wieners well what about hbo
this isn't helping us butters
the sony people might not be our biggest problem

of course we're going to go with the ps they're blacker
then join us we need people to help us be the first  inside the mall
uhhh we're just gonna wait until the pss become cheaper and more available
no you can't do that
ya yo you can't you can't do that
don't you see this is about more than black friday battle lines are being drawn if you wait it out but everyone else has already decided to go with xbox then that will become the standard the ps would be like betamax was to vhs
what's betamax
exactly
what's vhs
look we're just asking people who want to play on pss to fight for what they believe in
sorry i guess we just don't care enough
come on sir stan there must be kids somewhere who will join us
lady mccormick i was hoping i could talk to you about kyle
yes what's up my lord
i'm not sure if his heart is in the right place if he were to everswitch sidesit could make stan's army problematic for us
but stan and kyle are best friends
true but we can't let kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ourslet's face it lady mccormick this is really about you and me getting xbox ones the others are simply there to help us get inside those doors
yes that's right
you have a strong influence over the rest of the men lady mccormick all i'm saying is when the time comes i might need you to use that influence to have kyle taken care of do we understand each other
yes i believe we do
hey you damned kidsget the hell out of my yard
fuck you dude this is the garden of andros
no it's my damned garden and i'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it
seventyinch television huh that would be good oooo but  off a computer huh maybe i'll be able to snag both

cccartman's army is getting bigger every day in addition to the federation and the kindergartners the xbox army now also has the kids who play harry potter the jocks the swim team and the glee club
word is that the sixth graders all prefer xbox too and will team up with cartman as well
and who do we have on our side
uh besides us it's the book club and janice pinkerton
did you ask the vamp kids
they're still undecided
there has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side
playstation
look sir stan it's probably time to give this up
we're just a dying breed stan xbox is going to win this whole thing
so we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on what would they do on game of thrones what would they do when things look their darkest
huh isogashii yo
sorry to disturb you sir but we thought you should see this
omaeya kikei jishu taihen ne winter is comingu choose sideo nani kore
just a small down in middle america but apparently a war is escalating
sir if this were to become a news story and if the first people inside their mall all got xboxes well it clearly looks bad for our image
so desu ne
what's going to be the big item everyone goes for this black friday it just might be the playstation  sony has just announced they offering a special black friday bundle called the brack friday bunduru which will include four controllers a map of japan a hundred dollar rebate and allow you to automatically preorder for metal gear solid v no doubt sony has just raised the stakes
yes good federation kids you're learning to fight with your hands keep pushing kindergartnerssir kyle i know that sony's offering a special brack friday bunduru you know the xbox is still better right
yeah but why can't xbox automatically let you preorder metal gear solid v
sir kyle preorder doesn't mean shit okay when you preorder a game you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in california haven't even finished working on yet you know what you get for preordering a game a big dick in your mouth
alright listen upthe mall is no longer allowing people to line up for black friday until thanksgiving nightit's okay to hold places in line we're handing out wristbandsaugh hold on oh god
wristbands
back back all of youif that's how you are there'llbeno wristbands no go
oh

heh now you know how serious this is whatever your intentions before protect this town you are in charge now take thisdon't let black friday be the end
get back inside we have work to do
when we started this fight it was because we were tired of xbox people telling us playstation sucks now we have an army of our owni can't guarantee you will live but i can guarantee that before this is over the winner of the console wars will be decidedour new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the psall hail the princess
the princess yeah
previously on south park
now let me tell you child of a war that is about to comesince time unremembered there have been twoone dark and unforgiving the other pure and filled with lightat the dawn of war i stand alone looking out at would be the last battlefield for winter is coming and i am a princessonce a common lady of the dark army but denied my right to be called princess by birthi've betrayed my kindand now i have chosen my side that which i believe is best for allfor it has the dualshock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interfaceour land is split in two brother against brother friend versus friendand my parent will fight on black friday as well for what i do not know
what the hell is he wearin' now
my followers though few in number shall help see me through until i am finally accepted as a princess by all i cannot rest for i know that even now the enemy is training for battle also preparing for winter
en garde
alright stop stop stopthis is not how you fight you think this is a joke on black friday there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting xbox ones so what do we do we survey each enemy and we attack their weak spots scott malkinson has diabetes so we hit him in his weak spot
aaah god ow sorry
there's another army out there who thinks they're better than us and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore kenny get back to training
yeah
ah
cartman we should probably talk about our chances
the men are just inexperience sir kyle they need more training
it's not enough ever since kenny switched sides there are more kids that wanna go with ps on black friday
that goddamn traitor you know why kenny's doing this right because he wanted to be a princess and i wouldn't let himi said you can be a chick kenny but there's only one ruler and that's me
cartman released the pss cartman they're being reviewed people are liking them
i guarantee you kenny had something to do with sony offering a brack friday bundurujust keep them in training sir kyle two can play at kenny's backstabbing game
stupid assholeyes hello i'd like to speak to the president of xbox please the president of xbox like the head of xbox fine ceo of microsoft whatever put him on i need help blowing up playstation people eric cartman i'm a wizard and a king a wizardking yes no i'm not king of wizards i'm a king that happens to be a wizardjust put the ceo of microsoft on the phone
mr ballmer john and dave from marketing are here to see you
yes hello how are things going out there
sir the tides of war are changing
there's a king in colorado a young wizard who believes that sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid
he claims that with our help his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better
uhh what are you guys talking about you sound ridiculous
there's going to be a war in this small town on black friday and it's all over the news
guys these are console wars not some epic battle for a kingdom i mean come on
but this one kid said that he's a wizard and that sony is helping
guys guys guys it's just a video game machine alright microsoft's a company that tries to be above all the petty commercialism okay
okokay
okay
well black friday is still a few days away but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality
niles lawson is on the scene and niles what are you hearing
tom tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer males happy davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for black friday until thursday night in honor of the slain mall security officer the mall has officially decided to drop another  off black friday deals
happy was a good man too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner
captain captain the mall is dropping the black friday sale another
what
oh my god
they can't do that
what that's  off
oh god they're back the shoppers are back
everybody stay put i'll handle this
if you are here for black friday you cannot be on mall property until midnight on thanksgiving
we're notonmall property
well you're about to be
well what if we just walk really really slowblack friday
you're gonna have to walk slower than that you've got a while
we can walk really slow look
smartasses
paladin butters i was hoping i could talk to you about lady mccormick
you mean princess kenny m'lord
yeah whatever the little prick thinks he's daenerys targaryen i need to know how to deal with himhow do they deal with the queen of dragons ingame of thrones
they don't
well did you finish watching season  like i asked you
yeah i finished it
so what happens when the dragons show up
nothing the dragons are just still on their way they keep promising dragons but all i get are more floppy wieners in my face
butterbutters the key to our victory is following thegame of thronesmodel exactly i have to know what happens when the dragons show up so i know how to deal with kenny
whawhat do you wantmeto do
here's two bus tickets to new mexico i want you to take sir scott malkinson and go seek out george r r martin for answers
who's george r r martin
he's the guy who writesgame of thrones butters he can let us both know how to handle kenny and if we should betray clyde or not let's face it butters this is really about you and me getting xboxes the rest are simply there to help us get through those doors
hey i told you kids to stay out of my damned yard
do you mind we're trying to talk here
yeah well home come every time you talk to somebody it's about betraying somebody else
why don't you mind your own business
no listen for the last time we don't have any dragons to send them if some people wanna choose playstations it's their choice
sir mr gates is here
bill gatesuh i gotta gohey heeey bill gates actually showing up at corporate
hey steve how're you doin'
not bad you know just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled
i heard there's a little trouble in uh colorado somewhere
oh it's no it turns out it was nothing just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger
oh my gosh yoy know when i uh stepped down and left you in charge of the company steve uh i knew there might be some challenges for you
yeah well nothin' i can't handlethere might be some changes we need to make to our marketing but i'm optimistic
uh huh
you know i think we'll ultimately sell the number of unites we want to
you're right steve some changesdoneed to be madedo yo know what weakness is steve weakness is believing that competition is healthy see there was a time when xboxes and playstations could both survive in this world but that time's done it's all headed to one device that people game on watch tv on socialize on there's only going to be one winner i can't have you idiots throwing away everything i worked so hard to achieveclean that shit up
well come on scott you're lagging
i think my insulin's low i need to eat
let's just talk to this guy and then we can hit a mcdonald's oh here we go
can i help you
hello is this george r r martin's house
who is this please
uhhhh it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show uphello
i'm sorry but mr martin does not see fans
we're not fans
yeah we don't like it
we don't like it and i'm pretty pissed off if you wanna know the truth
about what
let me talk to george r r martin and i'll tell him about what
it's the red wedding isn't it you hate how i killed everyone off
uh no sir we just really need to know about the dragons but they never seem to show up
oh they're coming the dragons are on their way
when
you really wanna know
please it's urgent
alright king joffrey is still at king's landing but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan and his wiener gently hangs down between his legs soft and flaccid his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight
no uhno can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons
aw shit i think i'mi think i'm going to faint
uh what's the matter scott
i told you i have to eat every two hours
he's diabetic
oh jeez uh why don't you kids come out from the cold i'll order some pizzas
oh okay thanks
come on in i'll tell you everything that's gonna happen ingame of thrones
sir kyle i wanted to talk to you about stan
if you want to make sure i'm not switching sides cartman you don't have to worry stan is wrong
it isn't that princess kenny is loved by her army but stan is still the nuts and ball of her operationit would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their playstations if stan were to begrounded
grounded for what
that could be up to you
no cartman you said nobody will have to be grounded we're not playing dirty
fine sir kyle perhaps you're rightdid you know that stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security
what
seems a little convenient doesn't itstan with somebody on the inside to help him get his pss who's playing dirty now let's face it sir kyle this is really about you and me getting xboxes the rest are simply there to help us get through those doors
don't believe ithe said that to a bunch of people
dude you'd better stop harassing me or i'm callin' the cops
you're callin' the cops
yeah
you're on my propertyi'm callin' the cops
well go ahead call the fuckin' cops then
oh ohoh it's you
tom i'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report
we don't go to work for another hour
we just got a call from bill gateshe says he can promise us a bigger war on black friday if we play along
he wants us to side with him
that's right tammy let's not forget that having a bloodbath on black friday is good for the news it's good for us the bigger the better
our job is to report the news not make it more violent
right tom because you're sooo about integrity let's goor maybe i should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to back to you
it's the morning news with tom and tammy thompson colorado's toprated brothersister news team
well black friday is just around the corner and tammy it's getting fierce out there
that's right and niles lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise
tammy the excitement over black friday is peaking and none other than bill gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger
that's right we just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their xboxes at incredible deals on friday so we've come to offer swords and battle axes whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers
we understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well
yes but we are limiting it to one per xbox follower because of course the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety
yes
hi is kenny home
uh yeah kenny's out back playing with his friends
forward menthat nono you you've gotta turn me
it's the enemy defensive popoppoppositions
protect the princess kill 'em kill 'em get out
i seek audience with the traitor lady mccormick
let them pass
welcome to my kingdom sir eric now state your purpose
the princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose
you can't win this guys look around you lay down your weapons and you can come back and fight for xboxes with us on black friday
you can change your mind instead of fighting with us eric
the princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that playstations are better she'll consider it
kenny we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while 'kay but you are never going to be a real princess
what oh the nerve how insensitive of you you cocksucking faggot
the princess calls you a balllicking lesbian
that doesn't even make sense
stan this has gone too far people are going to get hurt what you started is way out of control
whatistarted how dare you
all these people are going to be gaming on xbox you really wanna just game with craig the rest of your life
i would rather game with craig than spend one minute having to set up an xbox live account we will get our playstations tomorrow and you buttholes will have nothing
you're outnumbered ten to one and there's no time left how will you win
the gods will find us a way
so then samwell tarly sees the army approaching and his wiener is about this bighe knows that stannis baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold samwell has to rally his men so what does he do he takes out his wienerand he dangles it around for all his men to see
aaah
ooah uh sir you said pizzas were coming
yeah yeah they're on their way they're still coming so samwell's wiener goes
but you said they were on their way like three hours ago
if i don't get pizza soon i'm goin' to pass out
don't worry they're coming pizzas are on their way they're gonna be amazingnow john snow finally faces jaime lannister and this guy's wiener is you know huge right so it's not goin' to be easy
ehhh
mr gates i was hoping i could talk to you about the fight on friday
certainly uh eric right
uhh it's my lord wizard king actually having your leadership has certainly been a helpbut i hope that we're clear that this is my armythere can only be one person of royalty that's kind of the rules
oh i certainly don't wanna step on your toes don't worry i'm quite good at letting my ceos do what they want
your ceos
let's face it this is really just about you and me getting xboxes the rest are simply there to help us get through those doors
uhhh hmmm what
hahaa how's it feel now who's walking who through the betrayal garden
why don't you stay the fuck out of my business
why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard
ish ish ish oish haishooo
that was amazing sex i enjoyed it immensely how about you
tanoshikatta ne yeah it was fun
you know microsoft has given kids who want xboxes on black friday a lot of support seems a shame that the fight will be so onesided
eh nani kore tsukareta yo what i'm tired
black friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight that's bad for both of us there must be something you can give to kids who want sonys to make the fight more even
haikore ga arimasu
yes i think that will do nicely
'wiener wiener wiener wiener wiener
one wiener next to another wiener
wiener wiener wiener wiener wiener
two wieners alongside yet another wiener
party wiener party wiener party party party wiener party wiener wiener
soft wieners nice and soft nonerect wieners
keep them flopping flopping wieners floppy floppy dangle wieners dangle dangle
five wieners in my face
stop stop please i can't take any more
but this is the best part right before king joffrey gets poisoned everyone flaps their wieners all around his face
jeaaaaah
listen buddy you promised that pizzas were on the way if they don't show up right now you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands do you hear me
okay okay fine fine what kind of pizzas do you want
what kind do we want
he hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet
don't worry they're coming not just two pizzas there's there's gonna be five and they're gonna be huge you won't believe it
come on scott we're leaving
wait i haven't told you what happens yet
no black friday is about to happen and my friends and i have to be the first ones inside the mall to get xboxes
well why didn't you say so i can help with that
whatoyou mean
i'll make some calls i know a way to make sure you're completely prepared for black friday
sony ps no urazuke zenbu domo sumimasen
the president of sony bids you thanks for all your support of the ps
sore kara kono gifuto de princess no pawaa agemashou
he offers you this gift to once and for all make you an official princess and to give you the powers you need to win this war on black friday

wow kenny's a japanese princess
wooo
oh god we're done for
my friends the time is almost here let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before uscommander marsh  they're what  they're gonna what
tom we have breaking news from the south park mall in an effort to make sure everyone is prepared the mall has decided to push black friday by one week
what
the genius idea was proposed by george r r martin who also suggested fuck it let's push thanksgiving to december rd for pushing the date the mall is now reducing black friday prices to  off to the first hundred people inside the mallthis is going to be a fucking bloodbath tom there will be medical tents ambulances facepainting no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die

he did what he flew down in a parachute and did what
apparently he stopped microsoft from blockading the shipment of pss to the mall looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for sony
because because what because he's cute
cartman he's got everyone on sony's side we can't stop him
but what does he do besides that he's cute
sweetie bill gates is on the phone for you
tell bill gates to suck my ass mommomdon't seriously tell bill gates to suck my ass tell him everything's cool and i'll call him in a little bit
this would have never happened if you would have let kenny be a princess in the first place
he's not a princess he's a dude
well unfortunately for us he's now on the other side we are out of options
so what are you saying kyle
i have an ideai don't like it but i think it's the only choice we have
tom black friday is finally almost here and as you can see behind me holiday shoppers are really getting antsy people have been waiting out here since midnight on thanksgiving they're cold they're starving and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals joining me now is rick tellmorewho's been out here for six days and your five year old son was eaten is that correct
yes yes that's right we had to eat him we were all sort of starving out here so we drew straws and he drew the shortest one
what is it you're hoping to get when black friday does finally start
a a bluray player ninetysix percent off it's gonna be about  bucks
now some people might say that eating your child is not very christmasy what would you say to them
iiiiate my son for a bluray playerwith a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle janglemy son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho ho ho jingle jinglejingle jingle janglejingle jingle jingle ho ho
no doubt christmas is alive and well at the south park mall back to you tom
alright guys here's the deal the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers the kids who want xboxes plan to flank from the left hereour best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance here
at red robin
that's right red robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall
the key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the red robin before black friday starts
so how do we take over black robin
i have no idea
hey uh excuse me
yes
the uh xbox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides
what
go ahead and tell him cartman
alright on behalf of the xbox fighters of zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up okay
haha
shut up craig this is very difficult you guys win alright we'll all play on playstation s we still think xbox is the superior machine but you got too many people on your side and then kenny became a japanese princess
nobody saw that coming
look the truth is we all have a bigger problem now and you know it nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers
so better a ps than nothing is that it i think we'll take our chances on our own
we know a way inside the red robinyou don't think you're the only ones that thought of it we were going to use the red robin entrance too and we figured out how
red robin can be rented out for wedding parties if we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there
hey that could work
let's do this together dudeour only shot at playing any nextgen console is by teaming up if you wanna game on a ps then i do too
and you swear you'll be okay with that you won't talk about the xbox being better ever again
i swear stan
alright guys looks like we have a wedding to plan

ahh kawaii
sir stan i was hoping i could talk to you about the wedding
yeah sure what about it
i think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open we should stay back a bit from the doors
why
well think about itthe first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance it's best we let butters and scott malkinson go first while they fight we can simply slip on by
oh okay i guess that makes sense but butters and scott won't be able to get their pss
yes that's true but let's face sir stan this is all about you and me getting playstations the rest are simply there to help us get through
he's lying to youthey're just acting like they've given up but it's a doublebluff
dude dude
they're gonna betray you at the red robin wedding he got the idea watchinggame of thrones
dude shut the fuck up
who is that
he's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because i'm in his garden all the time
they're gonna lock you in
god damn it shut up
he talked about it in my garden to like three other people they're gonna lock you in the red robin and go get all the xboxes that's why he wants you to stay back from the doors
well why don't you just tell the whole world everything huh why don't you tell everyone whatprometheuswas about while you're at it
did kyle know about this
dude we're not gonna betray you come on did you seeprometheus i don't think the writers even knew what that was about
did kyle know about this
kyle thought of itstan dude hold on xbox one is fuckin' sweet dudeyou're a fuckin' asshole
fuck you get out of my garden
i'll shit in your fuckin' garden
go fuck yourself
well the wait is over and black friday is finally here
niles lawson is at the scene and it's about time niles
that's right tom mall officials have said they are ready and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbonthis year's ribbon cutter is of course george r r martin who um doesn't appear to have shown up yetbut uhh says he is on his way just like the dragons and zombies in his novels he is on his way
now just hold on a minute well i'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to colorado isn't on horseback
that may be true but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation
what's thatawww
okay cool could we set up the two long tables here like facing each other and then another one for the bride and groom back there
uh i heard a rumor may i ask who is it that's getting married
oh uum tom hanks aaand beyonc
it's it's real it's for real oho my god i love them
yesh kewl
so beyonc is not with jayz anymore
well clearly she wouldn't be marrying tom hanks at red robin if she was
uh guys guys not those tables get the good tables this is vip okay
has anyone heard from butters and scott malkinson the fuck are they
cartman cartman i heard that stan somehow found out about our plan
yes he did
well what the hell are you doing this isn't gonna work now
it's fine kyle everything's been taken care of stan won't be telling anybody anything ever again
what the hell did you do
what had to be done so that we can play our games on xboxes kyle
no tell me you didn't
he's not allowed to come out of his room so you can talk to him through the door
thanks mrs marsh
and keep it short he's in real trouble he defecated in a nice old man's garden
okokaystan stan
huh hello who is that
stan it's me
get out of here
dude i know you're pissed at me right now you've gotta understand that i did it because i know in my heart that the xbox is better for all of us
you completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had
you weren't playing fair dude getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair
i didn't even know he was working at the mall kyle
you didn't
but you couldn't just ask me because xbox people don't care about the truth they just care about seamless multimedia connectivity
i'm sorry stan i'm sorry this whole war has just got us all so screwed up i just want us to be playing call of duty on the right machine
you don't understand i'm never playing call of duty with you again
stan don't say that
get out of here i'm done with youmom momget him out of hereget him out
now listen up there are only eight of us now peterson was a great guy and he didnotdeserve to get beheaded like that now i don't know about you but i am sick and tired of getting to know people here getting invested in their personalities and their back stories and then having them diewhen those doors open we all stick together if anyone panics it puts us all at riskstay tough rookie

every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me
see that's the problem lisa you have a bad selfimage just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there okay
there's only one boy that lisa cares about
yeah lisa has a crush on butters
shut up
but lisa that's great have you told butters that you like him
no way i i'd just get made fun of
lisa this is exactly what you need take butters to see a movie or something it'll do wonders for your confidence
so then ah the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says i
uh excuse me butters
oh yes
um well i was just wondering ifmaybeyou would like to go to a movie this weekend
oh oh like a date oh no thanks lisa i really appreciate the offer but you're too fat for me

you guys come on that's not kewl you shouldn't rip on her because she's fat you should rip on her 'cause she's ugly okay she looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel and that's why she sucks alright
camptown ladies sing this song dooda doodacamptown racetrack's five miles long oh de dooda dayoh
what the fuck is your problem
oh hey wendy
are you just an asshole is that it
am i just an asshole
yeah
well mno i've got arms and legs i've got everything
lisa berger asked you out and you called her fat do you have any idea how you made her feel she's a really nice girl
ah i think she's a nice girl too she's just too big for me
she's a little overweight but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade
well kim kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby
what
i'm sorry wendy but i have a different standard when it comes to my womeni want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs and perfect ehhverything
this is a fantasy you moron you ever heard of photoshop kim kardashian is a short overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves
you're a liar
look it up stupidin real life kim kardashian has the body of a hobbityou're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl
uh take a seat wendy i guess some mean things were said and i need to get to the bottom of it
oh good lisa berger told on you good
uh no wendy apparently you called butters' girlfriend a hobbit
are you serious
you did you said kim was short fat and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit
that's not his girlfriend it's kim kardashian
uh but but wendy kim kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful mkay
right but she's not in real life she's a hobbit
oh she said it again
now wendy kim might be uh fullfigured but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters nkay have you stopped to consider that maybe just maybe you're jel
i'm not jel and i happen to be the biggest feminist at this school
uh that may be true but there is a very fine line wendy between being a feminist and being a hater mkay and you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly
okay kids there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker here to explain why kim kardashian is not a hobbit please welcome aquaman
uhhuh uhhuh that's right
uh oh
okay first of all i am not aquaman i am a recovering gay fish yes i have met aquaman i have hung out with aquaman but the only thing i have in common with aquaman anymore is my love for the seanowthere have been malicious rumors started at this elementary school that my beautiful fiance is a hobbit that is not funny and it is not truealright yes kim is heavier than most of her pictures show her to be yes she gets her hair lasered off her body yes she has a friend named gandalf who happens to be a wizardi'm sorry excuse me a minutebitch how are you not a hobbit again yeah yeah yeah yeah right rightrightrightrightright yeah okay yep yep let me get okay yep i got it okay love you toookay if my fiance kim is a hobbit then how come it uh how c then okay if she's a hobbit then how come she don't live in a hole in the ground boooooom all y'all just got lit up cuz she don't live in no hole in the ground she lives in a bigass mansion with me in her room that is slightly below ground so you can she she is sexy and womanly and she smokes a pipe she can blow them rings that go up over her head and hold upbitch you not a hobbit right  no i know you just you smoke that long pipe sometimes when you sit by the fire oh it's a oh okay got it got it what do you call it yep yep got it okay yep love you toothat is not a hobbit pipe for your information it is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin' so haha all you haters ha
butters butters come here for a sec
oh no you don't wendy you're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up
butters will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us
well alright but if you try to punch me i'll scream
i want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other this is lisa berger's class photo right
okay
now first thing we do is photoshop the bulges on her sides we select the eyes make them a nicer shape take off any blemishes on the skin lengthen the neck add more to the hair select the lips and make them fuller take out any puffiness on the skinhere add fullness to the breasts lengthen the torso take away that fold of skin streamline the shoulders put highlights in the eyes and there
that's lisa berger
do you see what i'm talking about
she's pretty
that's how people like kim kardashian destroy the selfmage of little girls everywhere
hold on are you saying that girl wants to go out with me

that's right
see the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit this has gone way too farand if society won't fix it i will
what are you gonna do
something that should have been done a long time ago
it's the morning news with tom and tammy thompson
a little girl is making big waves with her fight against photoshop
nineyearold wendy testaburger has started a campaign and tomorrow will speak before the state senate to ban the use of photoshopped images saying they're harmful to young girlsyoung lady what is your message
watching what photoshop is doing to society little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have we have to put a stop to it
and you're not just being a hater
nooo
'cause sometimes girls who aren't wellliked you know lash out at pretty and popular girls are are you wellliked at your school
not lately no
uh huh but you're not being jelly
no that has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against photoshopped images
okay because i do understand that the jelly school in aurora is ready to take you in is that right rick
tom i'm standing in front of the jelly school where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl we're being told if she doesn't stop the
that's not a jelly school that's a dunkin' donuts
well okay but you are a hater
that's finepeople can call me whatever names they want to i don't care there is a cancer in our country and i'm not going to rest until photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are fake and nothing in this world is going to stop me
agh what do you want
once upon a time there was a little hobbit who lived in the forest and all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful and even though she was short and fat and hairy this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like beyoncand then one day along came a magic power called photoshop and just like that poof the little hobbit was beautiful and even though she still couldn't sing like beyonc or dance like beyonc or act like beyonc or be a decent human being like beyonc the little hobbit was looked up to and loved just like beyoncsoon she had money and adoration and a hiphop fiance who loved her very muchi'm sorry hold up hold up i'm sorryeverything was good for the hobbit but then this mean little girl called the jelly monster she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar and the hobbit's fiance realized she was just a hobbit and you know what he said he said i don't care and then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit so the hobbit prayed to god and god said don't worry little hobbit i will go find this jelly monster girl and i will read her a story and melt her icy heart and the hobbit said thank you and the hobbit and god lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause i love her so muchi'm sorry hold up hold up hold up i'm sorry
ah ah i'm sorry i'm sorry that i have been jelly
sorry hold up i'm sorry it's okay hold up hold on i'm sorry
nono i've been a hater and i really am sorry

we paid a lot of money for that hologram you'd better find a way to get it back
project alpha
yes that might be our only option
what is project alpha
the first hologram we ever created to appear on stage it was a prototype but perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram
is another hologram bring up project alpha

bring it up
what is that
tupac

indifferent rectal semen splooge
sorry
indifferent rectal semen splooge is taken too come on
how are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken
i told you you just have to be really original with with your company name there's a lot of startup company these days
furry balls plopped menacingly on the table incorporated
that's available congratulations
it doesn't quite roll off the tongue
dude we're not gonna get any attention with that name
man this sucks
uhhh stan aren't you supposed to be in school
no dad we don't need school anymore we're forming a startup company
a startup company a company that does what
no we don't wanna do anything
yeah that's why we wanna have a startup company
yeah we're sick of school but all the good attentiongetting startup names are taken
wuhuhull boys there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name
nnnno there isn't
you guys you guys it's awesome holy shit you guys  you guys i've got it
what
it's the greatest startup company name ever
what tell us
washington redskins
washington redskins
it's sooo sweet
i'm pretty sure that's taken cartman
it's not dude some dumb courtthingy and the trademark got pulled you can use it aaand the logo
washington redskins  i like it
me too
what
dude there's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable
wait guys this this doesn't seem legal
kyle you're not hearing me the trademark has been pulled we can do whatever we want
you alright dude
yeah i just well i just thought our company name would be more like uh ororiginal
it's a strong name dude it's like agressive and masculine like boner forest but boner forest was taken
yeah but maybe we need a name that's more affirming like shows what we stand for
we don't stand for anything remember our company plan guys  start up cash in sell out bro down
i'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to
we already got a dollar
what
one dollar pledge
yahoo
i told you guys washington redskins totally gets people's attention
another two dollars
no way
sittin' on our asses here we come
another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the internet they're a company that does absolutely nothing and they're called the washington redskins  the redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on kickstarter  why did you give five dollars to the washington redskins kickstarter
i dunno i just uh they don't do anything that's pretty sweet i dunno i thought it was funny
by pledging just one or two dollars you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff if you pledge  or more you will receive this luxurious company micro badge
it's called crowdfunding using the internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal
washington redskins go fuck yourself  sure we'd be happy to take your money yup go to our kickstarter page okay nice idiot uh huh fuck you bye bye
you are eric cartman
yes i know
my name is dan snyder i'm the president and owner of the washington redskins
oh cool please take a seat
thank you but i will stand
nice i like that
young man we ask that you please stop using the name washington redskins for your organization
stop but why
because we are the washington redskins and we are a football team you have no right to use our name to get attention
uhhh the trademark got pulled so i'm totaly free to use the name actually  um butters could you get that
washington redskins go fuck yourself
look don't you see that when you call your organization the washington redskins its offensive to us
how is it offensive
how is it offensive jesus what
we are a proud team mr cartman we have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing
makes us feel like a joke
guys guys we have total respect for you when we name our company washington redskins it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people
uh i know i can't legally make you stop using our name but but won't you just do it out of decency
mmmm noooo because i don't want to aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard but hey from one redskin to another go fuck yourself
all around the world people are saying they are inspired by the washington redskins the internet startup company has raised so much money in kickstarter that now more groups are doing the same
more news on the washington redskins tonight their defiant fyou attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group isis the terrorists said they admire the washington redskins and want to try it and follow their business model
well let's not forget marsha that there's a people here okay who are not happy about the use of the name the football washington redskins
well yeah but does anyone really care about them
dude this is sooo cool we only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid
guys we need to talk to you i really don't think we wanna be a company that isis looks up to we should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them
oh no no you guys we started this company to do nothing if we start doing stuff now it'll put it all at risk
people aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything
digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the washington redskins are all about  now come on guys if you wanna be a successful business then you have to be honest about what you are  once you take a stand on something you're pretending like your company is about more than money then all of a sudden you're the nfl and and your players get caught molesting little boys
that's the catholic church
nfl catholic church same thing okay let's use the catholic church you take a moral stand on issues you say you're about honor and integrity and the next thing you know your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator
that's the nfl
it's the same thing kyle the point is if we as an organization claim to be about high morality somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be butters
oh no
all right i really don't want to have to do this but i'm not happy with the direction this company is taking
well what are you gonna do go back to school i'm not going back there man
maybe i'll start my own company
well that's fine you can't call yourself washington redskins
i don't want to it's a stupid name
well i guess everything's out on the table now huh kyle
yeah i guess i guess everything is
stan do you think our name is stupid too
i don't know i but i don't know if my future is with this company either
well then i wish you both well in your new venture goodbye
hang on is this the company where i don't get raped yeah hehere right okay i'm uh stayin' here
is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to isis you have to do something commissioner goodell what are you going to do about this
i will get it right and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that
what
we will continue to identify and add expertise to our team
that's the most ridiculous nothing answer i've ever heard what are you gonna do now
everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month
ugh this thing is broken
we can add and we will do more do more do more
get all the nfl owners on skype this thing is broken again
and so i call upon the help of all owners you cannot let my people be belittled like this
dan you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff let the goodellbot do it
the stupid thing isn't working
i will get it right
man that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it
look my team is starting to lose hope you have to use your influence to make these people change their name
did you tell them we're about honor and integrity
if the goodell bot is broken we must stay out of it more than even usual
and so i'm alone what if they ridicule the ers team next or make fun of jerry jones because his eyes are too far apart
my eyes aren't too far apart
if we get them to change their logo will it make you happy
uh i guess we can live with that
then it is decided we will make them change their logo begin mas behindthescenes underthetable enforcement of our wishes now
go
thank god
fuck youuuu fuck youuuu fuck you up there fuck you fuck you those words mean a great deal to us they help us express just how we as a company see things differently there are a lot of startup companies on kickstarter but after today i think you'll agree that washington redskins is the most exciting as you know the redskins have been on the forefront of kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves and now our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with  to begin with we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side but we didn't stop there we also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes and probably most exciting of all we have actually updated the company from the inside out we received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our redskins logo as a company we want to be firm but we also want to be flexible and so we thought if we have to change our logo it should be more in step with today's times but still define us as the leading kickstarter company what we came up with is the new company logo that i think you'll all agree is very exciting  now when people hear the name redskins they will immediately think titties and balls it's just a bold new way that we can say we don't fucking care go redskins
it's so awesome dude our company already has a hundred backers and we still have  days to go
yeah
you okay bro
i just never saw myself owning a company called furry balls plopped menacingly on the table inc
give it time it'll grow on you
why don't we just call it untitled startup company
because that sounds like we don't have anything we've been through this already stan
yeah i know that but a good company should never have seven words in its title
well whattaya mean
i just feel that somewhere out there there's a perfect startup company name and i need to be free to go find it
oh well i certainly don't want you to feel that furry balls plopped menacingly on the table is holding you back
good luck with your company dude
yeah good luck with yours
it's just incredible harry everyone is using kickstarter for everything
and for every project funded we get
it's like we don't even have to do anything and we just make money
sitting on our asses here we come
cawcaw cawcaw  hoohoo hoohoohoo
huh
goooood morning guys
happy deadline day
we made it guys we cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in     that's the deadline
oh boy this is like christmas morning
what the hell can't find the server  kickstartercom  kickstarter where is kickstarter get it up on the phone butters come on i wanna know how much our company is worth
it's not coming up on my phone either i holy mother mary
what
somebody raided kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground
what
somebody killed kickstarter
who the hell would burn kickstarter to the ground  oh my god that weird little jewy guy kyle
what the hell is wrong can't find the server kickstarter
you song of a bitch
what
you broke kickstarter
no i just can't get it to load
nobody can it's gone you just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be
my company was on kickstarter too why would i get rid of it
well somebody did
it doesn't matter you guys there's something a lot more important here  do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together we all had a common goal and we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down but somewhere between starting up and selling out we we lost our way we can't do this on our own we need each other
he's right we should do a merger
a merger it's too late for that you guys kickstarter is gone we don't have a company we don't have anything
yes we do we have a sweet name  i was wrong cartman washington redskins is the perfect name i think maybe i was jealous that i didn't come up with it
it is really sweet
and we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out
yeah we can do it fellas it'll be like old times
whattaya say cartman
fuck you fuck you everyone yes fuck you all thanks  how do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace as you know our goal at washington redskins is to not do anything and make money not doing it
when kickstarter went down many saw their startup projects die but here at washington redskins we saw opportunity people still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects and with the redskins you can now go fund yourself  and the idea is simple you the people go out and raise all your own money and give the washington redskins
you will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing it is the biggest fuck you we have ever come up with but we didn't stop there because a new company direction also means of course a new and improved logo
go redskins
a beautiful night in arlington texas as the dallas cowboys get set to take on the washington redskins that is of course washington redskins the football team not washington redskins the audacious crowdfunding company
yeah and if you ask me the redskins are a scam
you're talking about the crowdfunding company redskins right
that's right anand now you've got terrorist groups like isis using the redskins to raise their money ii don't like what the redskins are doing
those redskins
yeah whatever
no no we cannot give up we have been through too much together we have fought eagle and bear the eagles only beat us by three points
don't let them break you don't let them win
and the cowboys are still set to kick off but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to
yeah and jerry jones must be happy this means a forfeit another win for the cowboys
wait a minute it appears a lone redskin is making his way out of the locker room  the cowboys kick it off
hut hut hut hut  hut hut hut hut hut hut hut  hut hut hut hut hut hut
oh
just stay down for the love of god
hut hut hut
stop make it stop
just stay down
please
just make him stay down
go redskins go redskins
boy this is the life huh guys
we finally did it
i just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch
what the heck is that
whoa whoa what
change your name
it doesn't belong in today's society
change our name
but you all thought our name was sweet
there's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated a once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by cowboys in a defiant last stand
when was that
last night
until you change your name we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you
that's right isis will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising
yeah alright
good for you isis
well what the hell do we do
i guess we gotta go back to school
hey guys
morning
how's it going everybody
sup jason
hey dude sup
what are you guys doing here
what do you mean we're just going to school
i thought you guys said you didn't need school
yeah you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags
oh thaoh yeah the the startup company thing didn't really work out
but you told us all to go fuck ourselves
ogh noo noo you guys guys what what we said was
you told us your company was gonna make  million and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves
we were trying to be funny
yeah well no one's laughing kyle
hey wendy

yeah the startup company thing didn't work out
oh wow i'm shocked
so hey i was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid maze runner movie
you broke up with me stan you said you had to be free to chase your dreams
wendy i thought my life was going in a different direction and i just felt that i i really had to give it everything i had you know i had i had to focus on one thing
is that why you told clyde that you broke up with me because you're about to be  dripping in bitches
huh why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says
i'm happy stan i'm happy i know who you really are now you're someone who can't be counted on you're someone who can just bail on the people you love
dude people are pissed off at us
yeah it's fucking crazy
doesn't anyone understand the significance of i'm sorry anymore
yeah well said kyle good point what what happened to the significance
well i guess let's just be thankful we're not butters they won't even let him come back to school
all right everyone thanks for coming as you know we urgently need to discuss the matter of butters stotch who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back are we all set to start
almost we're just waiting on mr mackey again
awww do we need mackey here
yeah all he's gonna talk about is how he's glutenfree now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing
well you have to admit he does look a little better
he doesn't look any different to me
in the cheeks you don't think he looks a little fuller
it's just the new diet fad
sorry i'm late i had to stop and get my own breakfast because i figured y'all would be having doughnuts but i'm actually glutenfree so i can't have doughnuts m'kay
yes mr mackey we're all aware that you're glutenfree now
i'm just sayin' that i personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here please
right so the issue as you all know is that butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off
that's probably gluten m'kay
oh god
gluten causes sluggishness irritability and nearly all behavioral problems
i seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore
see that's probably the gluten talkin' uhkay if you cut out gluten you don't ever get pissed off
really mwell i might just give this glutenfree thing a try how does it work
oh no don't try oh god here we go
i don't know what we're going to do it's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us
right what the fuck is going on
you know what we gotta do guys  we've gotta throw a big fuckin' party

yeah how do you make everyone like you you have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool
dude that would have to be like the best party ever
well i'm down between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them
hey that might work but it can't be a party for us
right it's gotta be an awesome party for
for someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on
what
no no he's right we've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go
we lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever we're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band
a band holy shit stan didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows lorde
yeah he said some guy at work is lorde's uncle or something
oh my god we've got lorde to play live
this will be awesome
so who do we throw the party for
what do you mean we have a friend who needs us right now and we can't let him down
all right that was get this party started and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever is that right boys
yeah it's going to be this weekend
you know we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time
now this party is also for a good cause because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes scott malkinson is that correct
you you know diabetes affects us all but it mostly affects scott malkinson
yeah and we just you know we we just can't turn our back on him
must be pretty special having a big party in your honor scott how does it feel
i actually have plans this weekend
i actually have plans this weekend i'm scott malkinson i've got diabetes
all right well we've got lots of people callin' in caller what's your question

nope we're gonna have all the pizza you can eat twenty different cakes and lorde is going to play live
all the pizza we can eat
believe it dude
all right this better be good
all right it's sure to be a blast phone lines are going craaazy
sweet
next caller what's your question
yes will there be glutenfree options for people at this party
excuse me
well i've been glutenfree for about a day now and i have to say i feel sooo amazing i just want to make sure there's food for all of us
mark in fairplay you had a comment
yeah i agree with the last caller i was in a restaurant and ordered the glutenfree quinoa salad and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich it's like get your secondhand gluten away from me
all right all right next caller you got a question for the boys
yeah i swear if i hear another person talking about being glutenfree i'm gonna piss in their face
what the hell is gluten
hello everyone my name is john garner and i'm a nutrition advisor from the usda i want to clarify the usda's position on a healthy diet there's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately people saying that gluten is the cause of cancer gluten should be avoided gluten can make your dick fly off but let's set the record straight
make your dick fly off
people believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier but of course that's a bunch of hooey hooey is the preservative found in processed foods that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity you might say well there's fat in butter too but that's just poppycock poppycock first came from india and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey the good hooey not the bad hooey so what is gluten
yes thank you
simply put gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away  flour is of course just wheat and when you add a liquid to flour you get dough  dough that makes breads doughnuts pasta and all the hooeyfree foods that humans enjoy  now if we wash the dough of all its starch we can actually distil the wheat down minus the water minus the starch and what we're left with is pure gluten not a bioweapon just harmless flour protein
then eat it
excuse me
if it's not dangerous then eat that pure concentrated gluten okay
yeah alright  dup dup
oh you see that his dick's flyin' off
oh my god these people don't even know  hurry you gotta go
oh jesus hey it isn't safe in there  get out of there
get out you're not safe
you gotta get out
hurry you gotta go
what about the powerbars the powerbars
yes
hamburger helper
that's all gluten
there's hot dog buns in that cupboard sharon
hey dad i need to talk to you about this party we're having
oh my god the wheat thins
it's in the triscuits too randy
wait wait ah i might need those
this stuff will make your dick fly off stan
don't forget the freezer
oh god  chicken nuggets  breaded frozen burritos  flour ice cream what about ice cream
i don't know look at the ingredients
heavy cream sugar chocolate syrup  no ice cream's good for you
all right that's all of it
you sure all r all right you got those
i can get both of these yeah
all right come on
hey cartman
kyle it's all gone they've taken it all why are they doing this kyle kyle
dude calm down
there's no snacks left kyle they took all the snacks and the pizza and the cake and we're not gonna have a party
who took all the pizza and the cake  what the hell
kyyyle
yeah get it get it all yeah that's it burn you bastard
what are you doing to my farm
you son of a bitch did you not know or did you just not care keeyah
there's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing
we're working as fast as we can sir
are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction
we gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago you can see it already having a negative effect
we told people that whole wheat bread was healthy isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy
no we believe now that that's poppycock
all right listen up we have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat we are the usda without us people would be eating dirt and chairs whatever it takes stop this crisis
cartman come on dude you have to get up
what's the point everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck
we can't let our party suck
what kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake now all we've got is lorde
that's right we've still got lorde you talked to your dad right stan
i'll be back
you know what i'mm gonna miss most pancakes i keep having dreams of aunt jemima she's trying to tell me something but then she just fades away
cartman we can't do this alone you have to get up
there's nothing left you guys the world is upside down things aren't gonna get better they're gonna get worse
yes
hello sir we've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home may we come in
gluten expohn oh not here
can we come in please
wuh sure
what's going on
well that's just a beer
oh jesus
beer is all wheat dad
shuut up  beer is bad for you
we're gonna need you to come with us sir don't touch me
look i'm ok yuh you wanna see my dick
we just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on
no not papa john's  i don't wanna go to papa john's  you can't make me go to papa jooohn's
how long do i have to stay here
until the usda gets control of the situation sir
what am i supposed to eat
it's okay there's lots of toppings just eat the toppings
how'd you get exposed  bagels gravy
beer i didn't know it had gluten
there's always somethin' for me it was the soy sauce  sneaky sneaky soy sauce
we're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there but it seems impossible to contain
and we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves
we've been running simulations but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics here look this is what we've been recommending for the past three years  five basic food groups not four we were wrong about that we now realize of course that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison  sir to combat the gluten we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups but so far no answers
sir the feds are here
oh shit
tom vilsack
yes
michael taylor fda
yeah thank you but this is a usda problem
anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too
dad dad
stan hey how's my boy daddy's gonna be all right okay
yeah dad you know that guy at work you said is lorde's uncle or something
i can't touch you or hug you but but i'm right with you do you understand

no food at a party and i thought i was handicapped
hello eric  come on over here sugar
aunt jemima
there's people in trouble eric they need to be shown the way
i don't know the way aunt jemima
you need to get to the usda child they're lookin' for a sign
i don't even know what that means
when you're stuck look to the pyramids

they've got it wrong child  the world is upside down
oooo trippy

they've got what backward
noooo  oh ohhh oh hoooh fuck i want pancakes
you can't just keep us in here
we're out  we're all out of toppings there's nothing left to eat
they're just gonna let us starve to death
they don't care about us face it we're already dead to them
well then i guess i might as well eat
there's nothing left i told you
there's plenty of pizza dough
are you crazy
i'm crazy hungry  oh oh fuck it's so good  i want more it's been so long
oh my god you  but you're okay
you don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic this whole thing was a setup man
a setup but by who
oh my god we we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out
maybe papa john can help us if we can get a hold of them then maybe we can
ngoh
there's a health crisis going on and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes for a long time we ignored it thought it would only affect the poor people who ate eggo waffles and pizza pockets but gluten can attack anyone this is not a time to party this is a time to get serious we're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family because we don't know how much time we have
well all right time for action indeed let's go to the phone lines go ahead caller
i knew you guys were going to bail on the party
we're not bailing on the party we're just think there's more important things right now
uh huh you guys couldn't get lorde to play could you
all right let's go to jamie in como go ahead
it's like ya ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away it's kind of like telling everyone to go fuck themselves
oh kansas watch the language there next caller you're on the air
why are you doing this party stan was it because you made people mad at school or because you just wanted to be a big shot
i we we wanted to bring people together and help scott malkinson but
so then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em i'm pretty sure scott malkinson still has diabetes
that is correct yes i do
you couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on was that it
jesus christ dude
wendy there is a health crisis right now
right and when things change or things come up you don't forget about everything you promised people
we had no idea what to serve people to eat okay we're gonna look stupid
thought so
ohhhhhh well all right next caller is eric are you there eric
kyyyle
cartman
kyyyle what does usda stand for aunt jemina said usda has to look at the pyramids
it's dinner time on the east coast in less than an hour people are going to die
sir they've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something
who is this
my name isn't important what matters is that the answer is in the pyramid
the pyramid that's ancient stuff you're talking about are you sure  bring up the pyramid
what what is it what is it for
we built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups
sir we abandoned the pyramid when michelle obama got involved
the pyramid down't work we already tried it
it's upside down
what
sir the pyramid is upside down
turn the pyramid upside down
you can't be serious that would put butter and fat at the top of the
flip the damned food pyramid
this is not fdaapproved
it's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes now do it
sir we've got a match
nutrition is stabilizing
we've got a wellbalanced vaccine sir

another morning waiting for the rundown school bus to take me to the rundown school but today is the day i finally have the guts to do what i should've done a long time ago  nobody notices what i have in my front pocket a little surprise for them all  i'm prepared for this but still i wonder will i have the guts to go through with it damn right i will
are you okay cartman
yeah i'm good how are you kyle  they're all gonna pay every day they pushed me and pushed and if it happens again today it's going to be the last time  we'll find out today at recess won't we oh yes we'll find out today at recess
hey eric i'm not suspended no more
good for you
i think someone's in there
no god damn it no  who's takin' a shit
occupied
i called dibs on stall  for all recess craig
you can't call dibs on a toilet
son of a bitch  oh no no no no i cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time
then don't eat  egg waffles for lunch fatass
alright that does it  i'm sick of this shit and i'm not gonna be  taking it any longer  you all pushed me to this
what the hell do you think you're doing
i'm going to the potty
this is the girls bathroom
alright i need to tell you something wendy i'm transginger
what
did you notice the bow  i'm not comfortable with the sex i was assigned at birth so i'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice now get out of my way i have to take a shit  aaahhh
get out of here
don't give me any more issues than i already have wendy  oh wow this is nice in here the girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys
what the hell is that
cartman is using our bathroom
dude this is awesome i should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago
hey i'm gonna tell on you
it's okay red i can take a shit here i'm a dumb chick too
i want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom
because i'm transginger i looked it up that means i can use the girls shitter
you are not transgender eric you don't even know what that means
yeah uh huh it means i live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but i'm really a girl
all right well if you identify yourself as a girl you must find yourself attracted to boys is that right
that's actually not true i can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger i'm attracted to check the state bylaws
alright listen eric
erica
listen eric you must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom
all i know is i'm transginger and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers
with the what
cisgender it's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender if you identify with the sex you were born with then you're cis
but then cisgendered is just normal
saying normal is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group  trust me you don't want this hot potato just let him use the girls room
but this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about it's eric cartman
nobody else is gonna know that you better just give him what he wants
sooo eric cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate
actually  it's more like a royal flush
gerald broflovski
yes
brandon carlile reporter spin magazine i was hoping you could help me make sense of somethin' i understand you had a very large party in your back yard last last sunday was it
that's right  my son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes
i also understand that a very famous pop artist lorde was the entertainment at that party
oh yeah yeah the kids were pretty excited
well it eh it's just a little curious you know why a hugely popular top artist would play such a well no offence but such a humble venue
sorry i don't think i get your
you understand we deal with a lot of fake stories at spin  was just wondering how the boys got someone like lorde to play
from what i understand she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something
you wouldn't know who
no does it really matter
lorde is an incredibly talented and downtoearth young lady it would be a shame if someone was having fun at her expense
randy whose are these
aaah i don't know why
why because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans
in my jeans
randy do you have something to tell me
yeah i do
come on you've been in there for twenty minutes
yeah recess is almost over
there's two more stall in here gals go ahead
not while you're in here
oh my god you guys are so cisginger sorry i'm different but you can just suck my clit and my balls
eric there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is
okay okay okay you guys you know what you know what  that's what  suck my clit and balls
erica i believe we have a solution to this little problem
i don't have a problem principal victoria the cisgenders have the problem
if it is agreeable to you erica we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you
excuse me are you talking about my own special executive bathroom
would that be agreeable to you
oh my god
that isn't fair
wendy just go with it
yeah just go with it wendy cisginger bitch of course being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me i might have to approve certain aspects of this solitary location
yeah sooo i'm thinking of water feature here you know get the sound of running water yeah kind of zen it out
uh huh well why don't you put the water feature on this side
oh on that side
you know because you've already got ac over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall
oh i like that that's gonna look nice yeah
yeah listen i don't know if i can keep doing this my wife is starting to suspect something i just had to tell her i like the way fishnets feel
i know your wife means a lot to you randy  but you can't leave us hanging you've got the purest shit out there it's worth a lot to us
you think you're gonna get a good product when i can't even think
how many times have you said i think i've lost it and everything turned out to be okay
every time
every time come on get back to work and see if you get panicked again call me
yeah yeah i will yup
you wanted to see me
sit down ron  whattaya know about one of our artists lorde
seventeenyearold girl from new zealand great songwriter  humble
wrong  she's a yearold man in colorado
what
he writes the songs sends us the demos we fudge them sell them as a brooding yearold girl way ahead of her time and nobody knows the difference
huh  holy shit
he makes good stuff stuff that sells but he's getting edgy feet i want you to keep an eye on him and if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth well you know what to do
lorde lorde lorde lorde lorde lorde i am lorde i am l i am lorde i am lorde lorde lorde lorde
randy

it it done it is all ready alright alright move aside everybody move aside please i gotta go  oh ahm this is gonna be so awesome  aha lock privacy oh this is gonna feel so good  perfect  yeah you're gonna take it you're all alone now toilet nobody can hear you scream yeah you're gonna open wide  you're gonna take your punishment that's right get ready  oh my god this is so awesome you guys it's just like at home
peter nelson
yes
brandon carlile reporter spin magazine i understand you work at the us geological survey
yeah that's right
i also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter lorde
alright look i am not her uncle i i just work with her okay
work with her how
i like lorde uh she's really nice and really talented but she lives a double life
how's that
lorde isn't just a singer she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology
the what
she just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time she's a good geologist when her music career took off we thought she'd be gone but she still shows up usually right after lunch
hey cartman heard you're transgender
yup you know what hillary says you can suck my clit and balls
well i know i'm not even gonna get it done i swear he gives us too much homework anyway i
hey guys
wendy
how's it hanging'
whoa
huh
whoa wait is that
holy moly
hey what the fuck dude do you mind this is occupied
it's cool i'll wait
dude this is my fuckin' bathroom
i want her suspended and i want charges brought up for sexual harassment
i'm sorry erica but i spoke with wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable
wendyl fucking wendyl grow up wendy
you'll just have to share eric why can't you understand that
because i don't want a chick watching me go poo
i thought you were a chick
no i identify as a chick but i'm still a boy you can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude  that is my waterfall and those are my christmas lights
dude you need to put a tighter leash on your dog
what
do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay  oh yeah she's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls but she's dating you so what does that make you stan a girl stanan's a girrl you'd better curb your dog stan you'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you
shelly that's enough time on your phone
leave me alone dad stop nagging me all the time
you know we're all cutting down on phone time
don't limit me you don't even understand me
yeah i don't understand you at all a lot you know
uh hey dad i need to talk to you
oh really about about what
dad is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside  i mean can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex
yes yes stan i am lorde
what
it started off so simple there's a guy at work hanson he would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up you know not only that but he was in there all the time i finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman i called myself lorde have you ever been in a woman's bathroom stan it's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone it was so freeing i started singing while i was in there and then i started writing things down
well you said you knew a guy at work who was lorde's uncle
yah that's my cover
the chick that wrote the theme song to the new hunger games is you
yeah  the record company messed it all up it was supposed to go hunger games yah yah yah yah yah yah hunger games but they just do what they want with my songs
whawait lorde sounds like a girl
autotune wanna see how i do it  i come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work i use this program to import the recordings i make on my phone  yeah yeah feeling good on a wednesday sparklinnnnn' thoughts givin' me the hope to go ohhhn  oh whoa what i need now is a little bit of shelter
dad lorde's music is actually really good
thanks but it gets even better when i add the drum loops  then with the computer i can actually quantize everything  backup instruments  and then finally i use the autotune  sparklin' thoughts feelin' good on a wednesday givin' me the hope givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn what i need is a little bit of shelter  stan
hey everything okay stan
i don't know where i belong
just hold it that's what i do now
hey what the fuck dude god fucking damn it
why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom
stanley do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom
i i just two people close to me are having gender identity issues and i'm i'm confused
he's cisginger he's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night
you wanted to see me boss
yes please have a seat lorde
hi carol
lorde
lorde we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off
well my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined
amazing yeah uh lorde for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to uh find your own space to go to the bathroom  everyone loves you but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom
i like the women's bathroom i feel safe there being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity to my music
my girls are big fans of your music lorde but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with
with what  with what
you are watching e entertainment news that's how low you've sunk
it's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer lorde the singer went dark on twitter claiming severe depression and stating  i realize now that i make people uncomfortable i need to give this up and go back to just being the old me spin magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit and will be releasing a tellall article about the troubled artist next week
oh here he comes everyone it's the cisginger think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom
yeah what's the big idea harassing erica stan
at this school it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis right guys  what we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant you know what we call those cissies
yeah stan's a big old fat cissy
awe come on lay off him guys
oh what are you a cissy too clyde
no no just he is
you just gonna drink beer alone all day
it's okay it's gluten free
all right  do you know why young people like lorde so much  it's because she's something different kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it lorde represents something in all of us the truth that wants to be heard if i could talk to lorde right now you know what i'd tell her i'd tell her not to let people change who she is i'd tell her that if people are making fun of her it's probably because they lost touch with being human i'd tell her to keep on doing what she does because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside then we all lose that's what i would say to lorde
and so it is with great pride that i can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in
i don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it it's gonna be all crowded
anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care
hey where do you think you're going
to the bathroom
oh no you don't you've gotta use the cissy bathroom  well go on cissy
wow this is is pretty nice feelin' good on a mondaygot my space all the freedom i needyah yah yahby myself yah yah yah

hey boys are you excited for camp next year
yes counselor steve we like the tugofwaaarr
all right well just keep working on those donations
come on mimsy we gotta figure out how we're gonna make handicar a thing of the past
d'oh boy
we are united as brothers because jast as handicar has taken away jobs from honest hardworking cab drivers it's also taken food  from the mouths of the children of car salesmen
well i don't have any children
who does this handicapped boy think he is he's not even in union
he's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient
aaand because he's handicapped he can use special access points and parking spaces that kid was born with an unfair advantage
who is this rat
his name is timmy burch  and if you don't do something quick you're all gonna be out of work for good
who are you
just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs that's all
nobody takes jobs away from us we need to speak to mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business
or maybe we can have the police shut him down
hey i got an idea why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with handicar's popularity in the marketplace
just ignore my friend he's mentally disabled
aw yeah don't mind me
now listen everybody if you're a sheepherder and there's a snake taking away your sheep what do you do to the snake
offer it last year's christmas in rocksummer prizes
no you fucking moron you kill the snake
hey wake up you little scab
tutih tuhtimmih
we got a message for ya from the union
just imagine it mimsy a whole summer to ourselves to do what we want it's going to be awesome  well well hello gentlemen i understand you've taken care of our little problem
yeah we sure did
let's just say he'll be laid up a while
yeah we snuck in his room last night and we broke his legs
oh boy that's greatwait you what
timmy
i am lorde lawdy lawdy lorde
but we broke his legs both of them
let me give you guys a hot news flash if you want to hurt a crippled kid you don't break his fucking legs
how can people be so ineffectual mimsy
d'uh i don't know boss
these are supposed to be men who care about their occupations
d'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs maybe handicar is a kind of economic natural selection where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones drrrrr
shut up mimsyyyy
right here is good  thank you i can just use the app to tip you right
timmy
ohohh this is so handy  thank you
timmy  tiiimmih timmih
hey timmy it's your friend from camp nathan
timmih
listen you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting admit it you've got more customers than you can handle
timmih
i've got an amazing idea why don't you let other people drive handicars too think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business
hmmm timmih
i'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers
timmy
that's great summer camp here we come  now kiss your business goodbye asshole
d'ah i don't get it boss i thought you hated handicar how come now you wanna work for 'em
it's very simple mimsy i'm gonna take down handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers
d'ahhh sexual harassment boss
it's simple if you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct now you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me
d'ah oh boy
timmy hello ma'am handicar at your service climb on in  so let me ask you a question would you like to see my dick
sure would you like to see mine
uh oh
mimsy hel help mimsy  and i thought a shark was bad
come on honey it says our handicar is just pulling up
timmy oh hi gerald sheila
stephen what are you doing
you didn't know anyone can be a handicar driver now all you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a handicap i've had my handicap for about three days now get on in  i'm telling you gerald havin' a handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side
timmy
timmy
timmy
the world of transportation is really changing gerald
d'aww gee your idea to have handicar expand really worked boss
'scuse me out of my way please i have a handicap
i had a handicap way before you got paid to have one
d'ahhh you sound like that matthew mcconaughey guy ah i drove a lincoln before i got paid to drive one drrrr
shut up mimsyyy
for the pat eight years tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport and now the president and ceo of tesla motorcars elon musk
today i am proud to annouce the tesla d the most innovative and efficient worldfriendly mode of transportation ever created any questions
yes ahh what about handicar
what about it
well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to rideshare is even more convenient and ecofriendly than electric cars
how do you intend to compete with this boy genius in colorado
i am so sick of hearing about appbased ridesharing the future of transportation is the electric cars not wheelchairs
don't worry elon handicar is just a small company
oh sure operating in a few small towns but when they start absorbing the taxi markets bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world driving your kids to and from school delivering both people and things
we can't compete with handicar it's just so damned handy
if there is a way to reduce handicar's positive publicity then we need to do it now  and you you say it's theoretically possible
of course it's very simple if you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing all your sheep how do you get rid of the snake
who's the sheepherder
you are
who's the snake
handicar
d'ah it's an analogy
shut up mimsyyy  if you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity
timmy
timmy
hey timmy how is the fundraising for camp going
timmih
that's great i can't wait for camp this year  we are doing some fundraising too have you heard of my friend elon musk from tesla
good day to you
timmih
hey how would you like to have a friendly little race it would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours
d'ah we're gonna get timmy killed in the race huh boss
shut up mimsy
whattaya say timmy a friendly race this saturday we'll see you at am sharp
hey everyone you need to see this
what started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis as electronic cars challenge the oil industry and transportation alternatives fight for dominance the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the 's it appears that the world is once again on the brink  of wacky races
wacky races holy shit
the prime minister of japan shinzo abe is shown insisted that any race would break the treaty of salzburg which called for a ceasefire to the wacky races for their senseless brutality they also claim that if a race does take place they would have no choice but to enter their completely selfdriven prototype lexus into the conflict the canadians and chinese are also saying they would be forced to race and no one yet has heard from dick dastardly or muttley unless a miracle happens this saturday morning the world will witness the fist wacky races in nearly  years
wacky races oh god wacky races oh my god oh my god wacky races oh my god
randy they're bringin' back wacky races saturday monring
i know are we watching at your house
that's it everyone we're out of cereal
no i didn't get any that guy has two
there's none left don't you understand
don't you see what they're doing this is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps
don't do the race you don't have to prove anything
he has to do it don't you see he has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible there are hundreds of people with handicaps now
timmih
but isn't that the problem i mean let's face it it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up anyone can have a handicap now i mean even matthew mcconaughey is a handicar driver now for chrit's sake
hey  i was drivin' a handicar way before i got paid to drive one i just like how it feels
look the point is that this is your opportunity to make handicar oops sorry  hold on sorry went too far  this is your opportunity to make handicar thee transportation of thte future think what you could do with all that money
and here they are the most daredevil group of sharedride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the wacky races competing for the title of the future of transportation cars are apporoaching the starting line first off is the lyft car  a ridesharing company out of san francisco next up is the zipcar a paybythehour concept based on chinese bicycles maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry russian right behind is the hummer salesman in his  hummer no class and there's ingenious inventor elon musk in his new tesla d oh and here's the lovely canadian actress neve campbell in the canadian conept vehicle the queef powered completely on female natural gas  next we have the handicar with timmy burch and there's the completely automated selfdriving car from japan limping along last are those doubledealing dobadders dick dasterdly and his sidekick muttley  and away they go on the way out wacky races  and this live coverage of the event will be braodcast all morning of course on cnn
jesus it's begun
god help them all
all i know is if dastardly and muttley are up to their old tricks there's gonna be a lot of violence today
you are watching bbc world
the vioent conflict over transport is underway and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember we return you now to our live coverage of the wacky races
as the wacky raccers roll down the roadway we see that the taxicab in in the lead with handicar pulling up the rear
timmih
all the cars must follow the same route first they'll leave the town of south park then navigate through giggling gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger a miss dotty applegate once the passenger is picked up the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in morrison  it looks like the zipcar is trying to vie for position past the hummer vehicle it's neck and neck as the wacky racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger  miss applegate is waiting patiently  and elon musk's tesla appears to take the lead
slow down i need timmy to pick up the passenger before we do
but i though we wanted handicar to lose the race
he can't just lose the race he has to get sued and lose the whole business that's why when he picks up the passemger i've got a little surprise waiting for him
d'ah hey boss it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya if you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad why don't you just tell your parents how you feel  you know tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react  wait wait i got it  shut up mimsy
hey mimsy
yeah
shut up
the canadian car overtakes the selfdriving car and now here comes the zipcar which is being driven by matthew mcconaughey
i was drivin' a zipcar way before i got paid to drive one
and look at this the lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger  now the lyft car must take the passenger to her destination but look at this the hummer salesman is running the lyft car off the road and the hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself
you've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here what do you think huh can you see yourself in one of these puppies
elon musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the hummer out of commission for good
wow
geez
god
did you see that oh
the passenger is being taken to the tesla d now  no way she just got snatched by the pissed off russian in his taxi miss applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch jimmy fallon  uh oh the canadian car has completely run out of queefs  with the race neearly over it's taxi out in front followed by selfdriving car and then pulling up in third is handicar
timmih
it's gonna be a close one
not too close boopsie
oh no dick dastardly is up to nodogoodery again
ohh ohh duuude
oh no ohh
oh no i can't watch
oooo booom
ohohohh
nice oh yeah
and there's handicar to pick miss applegate up
that's it handicar has the passenger we're almost in range another hundred feet  wait a minute what the hell are all those cars  holy shit
timmy timmy
aaaaaah
timmy
we're near the finish line the race is almost over handicar is in the lead still way out in front of the zipcar driven by matthew mcconaughey
sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward are we drivin' cars or are cars drivin' us
dastardly car is racing past both  this could be an upset folks
timmih
goodnight you son of a bitch  mimsy i told you to put the explosives under timmy's seat
d'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake softspoken douchebag that everyone loves
not that fake softspoken douchebag that everyone loves
oh my it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with matthew mcconaughey inside
mimsy
and there's the finish it looks like handicar has done it
timmih
a big congratulations to our fundraising champion after selling the handicar rights to elon musk timmy has raised  billion dollars for summer camp  great job to all of you this is sure to be the best summer camp ever

somebody i guess was spying on craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush and it's like it's like a yeti you guys wanna check it out
dude
that's horrible if that's true i don't wanna see it
you don't wanna see craig's mom's bush

letmesee
locked and loaded full metal bush bro
how'd you get that on your phone
oh um uh kennyoh it was on the internet yeah i just downloaded it off the internet and nobody knows who took it huh kenny
uh huh
that's terrible
i know right now everyone's gonna see it
hey craig have you checked out the internet lately
what are you talking about
ohhhh nothin' it's just that yyou might wanna invest in some hedge clippers
for what
ohhhh nothin' you just might wanna hire tarzan to do some landscaping work for your mom
what the heck are you doing
whoa butters chillax bro
when did you put craig's mom's bush on the internet
butters
you promised me we wouldn't get in trouble
butters butters
now everyone is gonna know what we were doing
butters i had tookay i had to put it on the internet
why
because stan saw the video on my phone alright if the video is only on my phone then clearly we did it if we downloaded it off the internet then anyone could have done it
i should have never listened to you ah i should have known this would get out of hand
butters don't start playing the blame game here okay you and kenny are just as responsible and the next time you wanna shove me just remember i'm covering your ass
hi everyone for those of you i don't know as well my name is roger donovan and un just like you i'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood
how are these drones legal my wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the internet like that
yes well luckily nobody's watched the video of coursebut the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular i mean anyone can get a drone off amazon for  bucks and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy ohohh god i'm sorry laurayou know i i meant the situation is pretty hairy right nothin' to do with you ppersonally i mean how would i even know i didn't see itum
look we're all here because what happened to laura could happen to any of us there's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now we're gonna be up to our navels with bushoh um up to our necks in trouble sorry
you know it used to be called natural completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing
it's okay honey the
but now because i choose not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be
eeww
i'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster
and and and that's the point i mean we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing that that
i'm not embarrassed about it it's natural
it's a lot of natural
look look why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us a neighborhood watch to make sure that our community stays safe
yeah but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood
it's simple
oh yeah this is gonna work great
are you happy now
what
is is this do you think this is cool
what does that have to do with me
see when you start invading people's privacy eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up  kenny  you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody
kenny has no idea what you're talking about dude
i was in the bathroom when you were talking to butters cartmani know what
you were what
i was in the bathroom
you were spying on me
no i was taking a crap and i heard you guys talking
but you didn't say anything that's fucking spying kyle
how is that spying
you were listening but we didn't know you were there how is thatnotspying you'r a dick you're a spying dick and now you wanna lecture kenny about spying fuck you hypocrite dick spy
hello can i help you
yes i'd like to return this drone
you wanna return it
yes i'm i'm not into the hobby anymore
the hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting how can you not be into it
look something's wrong with it it does things itflies by itself
uhh noo somebody has to control it
you don't understand it was in the garage and the battery was fully charged someone said they'd seen it flying around so i checkedthe battery was half empty
i'm sorry but we don't do returns
please i just want another hobby to get enthused about
sir did you try looking at the sd card all the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it
you think i didn't try that i pulled out the sd card it was all erased somehow it erased everything
uh sir did you consider that your son might have done that
no it's impossible he's not allowed to fly it without my supervision
oh for god's sakesgoddamnit get the hell out of herethat does it
you people have to do something you're the law and these things need to be illegal
but they aren't illegal mr tucker
our privacy was invaded and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife have you seen what they're doing
nono none of us watched the video but if we did we could handle it we're police officers we see sickening things like that every day
we understand the humiliation your wife has gone through mr tucker but we don't
i haven't been humiliated i've been wronged we are here to ask for your help now are you gonna help us or not
well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company
or perhaps a forest ranger
help us with the drones spying on us
all right all right we'll do everything we can
are you out of your mind what are you doing
butters
why would you turn craig's mom's bush into a music video starring us
because butters
why can't you leave it alone why can't you just stop
because butters kyle was spying on us okaykyle was spying on us and he knows that we put the video of craig's mom on the internet he found out everything that's why i had to make another video
why
because when kyle said he heard us say we made the video we can say we were talking about this video ohh thank you eric that's pretty smart i really owe you one
that poor lady her vagina is everywhere poor craig
butters we live in a world where privacy is gone okay it's it' just gone bud your wiener my balls they're public domain you can get on the internet right now and look at that chick fromhunger games' butthole we can either all freak out about it or we can just calm down because honestly i'm getting a little sick of covering your ass
heheh gerald is watchinghousewives of atlanta
you're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood
i am let's see what nelson's doingoh shitdude neighborhood watch i'm neighborhood watchi've been shotno noooo
shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an onduty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone and worst of all yes the civilian drone was black
what gives them the right to shoot down our drones
i wasn't doing anything wrong this is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere
it was about yay bigi mean the hair on it was out to here and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button i mean the the drone yeah that's what i saw that that's all i saw
while police claim they were only following standard protocol the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil
please disperse candles on top of drones are a fire hazardreturn to your garages
what the hell are these police drones doing we can't protest now
just hover honey they can't do anything if we're just hovering
randy we need to talk
okay
insidei've been going over it and over it in my head i thought butters and i were alone but then i saw you on the newsanother drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiastdidn't recall doing randy this is very important is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for droneflying enthusiasts
no i didn't
i thought it was just my drone but i think it might be all of them
what might be
once you eliminate the impossible whatever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth our drone flew the battery was drained the sd card was erased butters was the only other person who had access to it butters can't use the drone without my supervision so where does that leave us randy
drones are spooky
if they have minds of their own they're more than spooky i don't know about you but i'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby
the town of south park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police after police used excessive force at a peaceful protest the town has now broken out into fullscale riotsas the people of south park continue to protest the south park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew the governor has asked for help from the national guard to bring order to the town
tonight on an allnew a town in crisis over the matter of privacynow for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush
you've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues
i don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring neighborhood watch drones i mean where does it stop
it just keeps going on and on kind of like youri mean it just goes outside what most people would call acceptable
have you ever seen pictures of naked women before  it's not that weird
it's okay honey
i didn't see the video i don't believe in doing that but uh i'm just saying that the situation in in your town is unwieldy
please do not adjust your televisions
what is that
my name is stephen willis stotch the drone that took the video of craig's mom was my drone i didn't want to believe it but they do things without us knowing at this point i have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobbyall of you with drones please listen to me three days ago my drone recorded a video thatsomethinguploaded to the internet we all were told to respectfully not watch the video but on the pageit has over three hundred million views so if none of us watched it who didwe have to find a way to get rid of them before they get rid of us
oh hey butters sup
do you remember when i showed you the video of the little bird eggs well that's the last time i felt happy
dude what's the matter
i have to tell the truth i want you and kenny to come with me and tell craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll
okay okay okay come inside there's drones out here
i don't want anymore discussions eric i don't want anymore excuses
butters
i just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it
okay okay butters butters
i don't want all these drones everywhere nobody does
butters butters all right all right butters fine i have a way that we can get rid of all the drones
you do
yes everyone is sick of it it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop we can put an end to it all tonight we're just gonna need one thing
what
your dad's drone
no there is no way i'm gonna
butters butters butters jennifer lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself it started with her right just like this started with you spying on birds now i'm willing to bail you out of all this but i swear it's the last time okay
okay
time to end this hobby once and for allno noooo
alright we've got power prepare for takeoff
if this doesn't work we're dead
it'll work butters if there's one thing we've learned it's that drones can't resist craig's mom
we're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said no more just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones she did something miraculous and someday our children's children will still be telling stories about how craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away
have you heard the tale of craig's mom's bushand the night that it saved us from dronesnobody knew the power it hadthey just thought it was shaggy and grosscraig's mom live a life of shame and despaireveryone feared her great giant bush
they didn't
but then when drones were filling the skyshe unfurled her bush and she used it to flycraig's mom's bush craig's mom's bushgargantuan thicket of madnessbigger than earth and denser than goldtruly a magical bush to behold
well you see butters everything worked outoh thank you eric i screwed up everything but now everyone's happy thanks for covering my ass
craig's mom doesn't seem very happy
alright i have a way that we can make craig's mom happy
no nono i'm sorry thank you eric i screwed up everything but now everyone's happy thanks for covering my ass
you're welcome
and she flew and she flew away into the sunand then she diedcraig's mom's bush craig's mom's bushtruly a magical bush to behold

we're playing the terrance  phillip freemium game
i played that thing it's fuckin' dumb i ended up paying like five bucks
who makes this crap
oh it's tewwific that's  more american dollars in just one day
where is the roof on this thing
what's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval
ohh terrance  phillip how are canada's two favorite buddies
what gives you the right to make a stupid terrance  phillip mobile game who do you think you are
oh i'm only the prince of canada and this happens to be the minister of mobile gaming
we thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile gameeh
it's the dumbest game over all you do is collect and spend canadough
ey we know the game's not great but who cares it's free
but it'snotfree if you charge  cents here and  cents there then it's not free
they see through the charade
uh oh you think so
i think they see through the charade yes
i'm pretty sure they can hear us too
alright fuck it you've seen through the charade so you might as well know everything charade upallow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming for years gaming was simple you pay for the game and you enjoy with mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid but if youpayfor incentives you're rewarded
freemium the mium is latin for not really
it's a simple cycle a neverending loop based on rpg explore collect spend improve but whereas those just use the concept of xp or experience points we've introduced the idea of micropaying with money money money money money money money
it's what everyone is doing freemium games are what's now and it's all just a lot of harmless fun
you're in big trouble stanley can you explain to us how you managed to spend  on a mobile app
i'm sorry i didn't really i spent that much
you didn't realize what are canadian coins
you buy canadian coins so you have canadough
stan just because i make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on canadough
i'll pay you back for it okay
how
i don't know i'll figure it ou jesus christ
can you believe him heknewhow much he was spending heknewhe'd get in trouble but it didn't matteri hate to say it but this is a lot like his grandpa
wull whattaya mean
dad's always had a gambling problem he's got total addiction tendencies could he have somehow passed those demons down to stan
well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking
ihada problem but i was able to stop now i only drink glutenfree beer and wine but with stan i think there's some darkness inside him that doesn't allow him to stop
and so in conclusion the successful premium game is based on five principles entice the player with a simple game loop use lots of flashing chachings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves train the players to spend your fake currency offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency
so they'll forget they're spending money
and make the game about waiting but let the player pay not to wait it's a surefire way to make lots of money
we understand micropaying but can't the game hidden inside the charade it just at least be fun
no no it has to be justbarelyfun if the game were too fun then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun
what's this
your checks of course for ten million american dollars each
so this is everyone is doing this
ehhhveryone is doing it
it's just the way things are going
it's the way things are going
well i guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad
hey phillip
ohhh hey guys
you missed school today
yeah i just wasn't feelin' the best
did you play the terrance  phillip freemium game all day
well yeah i was sick in bed what else was i gonna do
how much money did you micropay today stan
nothing dude i bought like  worth of canadough but check it out i unlocked the stadium in toronto
you spent  and eight hours to unlock a stadium
you guys is it that much dumber than video games you play
yes
it's just something to kill some time like jimmy said it's a cool way to zone out
waitwaitwait jimmy told you about this game
jimmy toldmeabout this game
kenny who told you about this game
jimmy
dude what
the
fuck
pssst hey kid come over hereyeah come on over chcheck this out you looking to have some fun
what do you mean
the terrance  phillip mobile gameall the cool kids are usin' it
aw i don't know
come on just try it out you can be terrance or phillip or both you can walk around and collect canada cash to build new stuffit's the perfect thing if you're bored and honestly the best part about it is it's free i mean come on why wouldn't you download it and just try it out
hey uh jimmy can we talk
why sure fellasanyway be sure to check it out kid
dude what are you doing
just hangin' out what are you up to
you need to stop recommending that app to people
yeah
everyone we know says they heard about it from you
i just think it's a fabulous app that's all
it's not a fabulous app it's fuckin' stupid
let me ask you something jimmy what happens on level  after you get the ontario nugget
alright alright i never played it i stay away from the stuff
you just push it on other people
they pay me to
who jimmy who pays you
you've both done an amazing job new hospitals new neighborhoods all funded by one freemium game
ahh listen ahh we've been talking it over and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing
oh ah what is the matter
it seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect
but just look at all the things we're getting to build soon canada will be as advanced and developed as michigan
we're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford
hoh non well we certainly wouldn't want thatoh i have an idea how about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in moderation
ohhhhh
do you really think that would help
of course the alcohol industry does it all the time
you friends fun drink hot girls you're hot drink more expensive cars ass drink ass money you in a tuxedo threesomes vodka pussy drink drink drink you drink vegas fun pussy you in a tuxedo fucking this girl vodka drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy more tuxedos more cars more pussy more vodka drink drink drinkplease drink responsibly
come on this way stan i want you to see this there you gothat's your grandpa he sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time sound familiar all the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machinecome on dad we're going home
i'm going
do you know what you've done to your grandson you've infected him with your bullshit
what are you talkin' about
i just don't understand what iswrongwith you two what is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you
it's just
it's fun
yeah it's fun
it's not fun you two have demons you're trying to compensate for
well what about you you're havin' a glass of wine
i'm not having a glass of wine i'm having sixit's called a tasting and it's classy
dad i'm not addicted i can stop i just like playing it but i don't have to i'll prove it
yeah and if he stops i'll stop
all right and if you two stop then we won't have a problem anymorehm earthy bold hint of cherry aftertones uurp
is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their fehffree time i was just a middlemanpeople were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me i'm not the one who made it
but you accepted money from the canadian government to push a freemium game on us why would they do that
how do you get people addicted to crack you give it away for free you give away a little taste and then and then some people can't stop themselves
and now stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it how could you sell out your friend
i needed the money alrighti downloaded yum yum sparkly gem forest because it was free i love the sparkly little gems the sounds they made when i got new ones then i made my first inapp purchase before i knew it i had spent my allowance then my birthday money i lost my crutches
youhaveyour crutches
it's a figure of speech with crippled people we'd say we lost an arm and a leg but they ain't worth much
that makes sense
you're saging these games do this on purpose
why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while it's called a trigger a quick image to trigger the addict's brain they know exactly what they're doing
hey buddih come on guycome back friend you've got new buddies guywe've just given you  canadian coinsenjoy you canadough
free
what is wrong with you stan you said you stopped buying canadough
i didn't think i spent that much i i clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up
do you know how many songs i have to write to make back that much money
one
oh it's just nothing' to you isn't it
no no it's not
you need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way okay
i don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer
i am not chugging beeri'm sampling a flight of glutenfree german lagers with a french wine pairing it's called a smorgaswein and it's elegantly cultural
okay i need helpthere is something different about me you guys i know the game is stupid and it actually isn't even fun anymore i don't understand
fellas can i have a moment with stan please
sure come on guys
this is my fault stan i should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fanfantastic
it's not your fault it's something to do with my family it's like a curse
i know this stuff is hard to understand trust me i know i'm an addict too but i got help
how
what all the addiction programs say is true you've gotta reach out to a higher power stan you've gotta get down on your knees and you've gotta say i have a problem and you've gotta ask that higher power for help
we have to find a way to get the word out people need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems there has to be a way that we can get to the news company and sneak in and somehow borrow their tv signal if we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous then
it's done
wuh what's done
the word is outterrance  phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts i tweeted itit's trending
you son of a bitch you paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game
you what
now hold on terrance  philip there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game
but there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses
you didn't build a mobile game you built an addiction machine
minister of mobile gaming what's this all aboot
alright alright you've seen through the charade again let me explain how freemium gamesreallyworkthe truth is a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them it's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them that's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents
but then all our profits come from people with problems
don't think aboot that think about all the money here have a bump of coke
okay but we still won't stand for this
i don't know if you're listening but i guess i have something inside me that i can't control something kind of dark please help show me the way
you have summoned the prince of temptation for what purpose
whoa shit uhhh i have addiction demons and i don't understand them
then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soulso you got dopamine right that's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable like eating sex and that's just nature right like rabbits and fish and shit they need dopa mine so that they want to consume and reproduce
okay
but because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems you know it's not fuckin' rocket science this stuff
so there's nothing spiritually wrong with me
fuck no it's like okay it's like being diabetic you know it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way you know you've been eatin' gluten and shit and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver and something clicked and now you're diabetic forever right so like if you keep doing something too much eventually there's ummm a dopamine fuckup right and you're kind of screwed up for life
so what does that mean i i can get addicted to everything so i can't enjoy anything
yeah that's pretty much what it means
the addict people said something about me filling a hole
well who's not filling a fuckin' hole right you know i mean what kind of bullshit is that so let's talk about genetics now you still have time
yeah no this is great
okay let me get some visual aids gimme juuust a sec
here is a fact  of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics using slot machine tactics freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers
oh god he just doesn't stop
who is this guy
we're building a new canada with micropayments from addicts who cares you think the fucking alcohol industry cares they don't care that  are gonna get addicted they're counting on it it's the same with ut but we've got our eye on every addict's screenevery button they click we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats
why does he suddenly sound like al pacino indevil's advocate
hohon i'm much worse than the devili'm the canadian devil
oh dear god it's the canadian devil
beelzeboot
you discovered my plan but too latenow the souls of all canadians belong to me
oh no
oh what have i done
heheheh hahaha
so basically the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with um dopamine regulation and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuffokay so we kind of understand now champ
i guess so but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there
you know they all do it and it's kind of my deal i have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit but you know everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay
ding ey buddy where'd you go don't you want more canadough
what's this
that's what i've been addicted to it's a freemium game sending me push notifications
what you just collect coints
how much money can you buy today
no see if something's addictive because it's fun that's one thing but this is just blatant skinner box manipulation wait a minute who put this out
ah canada
oh that son of a bitch he's always doing this shit i tell him temptation has to be nuanced but he goes and does this crap again i'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick kid is that alright
okayaaaaahhh
oh pass interference interference
stan where are you going
i shall return do not attempt to stop me
told ya kid's got demons i don't do that
horror and sadness all over canada tonight when the prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game he apparently made a deal with the canadian devil
hey guy i'm the canadian devil
the canadian devil now has complete control of the soul of every canadian this is a sad day for canada and therefore the world
heh heheheh stab you
beelzeboot once again you lack any sense of nuance
who the fuck is that
well well my overachieving doppelganger you're no match for canadian satan
return from whence you came
ow watch it guy
sadly a shocking turn of events here as the actual devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the canadian devil this is certainly a conundrum for canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for for that let's ask the minister of sports in edmonton
well of course the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the canadian devil but then again he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years
screw that go canada
enough beelzeboot thy end has come
hey dude
hey
yyou alright
yeah yeah i think i'm gonna be okay
cool
my fellow canadians what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others we have all learned a tragic lesson together that though many sins are out there when you get involved with freemium gaming you are making a deal with the canadian devil we will no longer make freemium games and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts canada is back to being an ethical respected and shitty tundra
i'm gonna move here and here and then i'm gonna roll to kill this zombie
well okay good idea
what are you gaywads doin'
we're playing board games so that grandpa avoids the casino and i avoid freemium apps
well all right good for you guys tell you what i'll join you board games go good with a glass of wine
that's not a glass that's a trophy that you won for drinking
it's not drinking it's called a white zinfandel sipping sprint and it's competitive get off your high fuckin' horse
your turn grandpa if you roll a five or a six you can kill these zombies

fuck you
i understand your shock my friend but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten
you should probably listen to him dude
uh huh 'cause i thought i was messing with butters but i'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality
the people you are talking to are just computer programs my friend
guys tell him you're not computer programs
maybe we are
kyle just don't be a dick right now
i know this is very hard for you but we don't have a lot of time

whoa
the mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells it's mass calcify against into the void
dude that was total carnage
that was freakin' hardcore
can you believe that rooster played a kalonian twingrove with half his mana tapped
it was just decimation
it was really about the most man thing i think we've ever been a part of
we're going again on friday right
hell yeah
what's the matter kenny
i don't know it just seems kind of mean
what's mean about it
you feel bad for the roosters
yeah i feel bad for the roosters
look who's to say the roosters don't wanna play i mean they were goin' at it pretty hard
yeah maybe that just kind of what they do naturally
guys i think maybe kenny's a little hurt because he was the big magic champion and now chickens are stealing his thunder
no
huh a little bit
no
dude you know what we should do we should all go in on a rooster
dude totally with kenny's magic skills we could probably kick serious ass
what do you think kenny would that make you feel better huh come on where's that smile where's that smile kenny i think he's smiling you guys
hello mr mccormick surprised to see us
what do you mean
let's cut the crap huh we know there's an illegal cock magic ring going on in town we just wanna know who's leading it
what's cock magic
right roosters are being forced against their will to play magic the gathering and you know nothing about it because you're 'white' let's git something straight cock magic isn't an asian thing or a mexican thing white people do it too if they're poor enough you got a junked car in your front yard mr mccormick care to tell us where the cock magic fights are being held
i don't go to any cock magic fights
do you have any sympathy at all for the animals mr mccormick can you imagine being kept in a small cage barely able to turn around and then finally let out only to be blasted by arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards it's illegal and it's wrong and anyone i find involved with this filth is going down
now i don't wanna lecture anybody but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous
dad it's not that big a deal
it is a big deal okay people can get hurt believe it or not i was into cock magic back in college
you were
yes so i'm not some fuddyduddy who doesn't get it i just wanna make sure if you boys do it you do it right and safely
dad that's not that's not cock magic
oh not impressed how about this
what is it
hello we're looking to buy a rooster that can play magic the gathering
never heard of cock magic or roosters
uhhh we aren't cops or anything
come on to the back don't mind the smell  we only deal in the highest quality poultry planeswalkers are you looking for a new hampshire or a cornish breed
we don't really know the difference
well your new hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana these here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards and here you got your green mana necromancers lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue or blackstacked decks
do you think they're happy
do i think they're happy
yeah like do you think they mind being made to play magic the gathering
they're fuckin' chickens
well our friend here has some animalrights concerns do you have any freerange chickens
freerange chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards
aw screw the freerange chickens huh kenny
hey how about this little guy
that one's kind of young i don't even know what kinda cards he prefers
then he's perfect for us
what should we name him kenny i know how about mcnuggets

now boys boys ahi need to get serious for a minute i want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting since this is your first time first don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on second don't shoot anything that looks human and third never spill your beer in the bullet chamber
uh uncle jimbo we don't drink beer
you what
moh yeah that's right i don't think eight year old kids drink beer mmm
i like chocolate milk

the people of south park are humble and friendly but now a ticking timebomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony
yeahhh

c'mon let's move move
hey wait aah
is is it on okay okay people form groups and search the mountain report back here every hour you got that
mayor i might have an idea

if we can dig a very large trench we can divert the lava into a canyon and then it would bypass south park pretty much completely
and that would be good alright
uh  pretty sure
well what are we waiting for okay people change of plans half of you grab shovels
these look like its tracks he must have gone this way ned prepare some hk and some plasticine i'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation the higher up it bird  the higher up it goes the better it can breathe
look up there

you guys you guys i was just kidding
as some people of south park try desperately to save their mountain town others look for the missing townspeople but all must take every precaution necessary
okay people listen up as we near the top of the mountain the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great therefore i have specialordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety mr garrison if you would please
harbringers of sorrow natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress and the volcano is no exception but what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family here we see the stevens family enjoying a may picnic but suddenly daughter hears a noise it's a volcano junior seems worried but have no fear junior jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt  that's right jane duck and cover  so what will youdo when you hear a volcano erupting  that's right duck and cover  looks like you got the ideathank you and goodbye

mr garrison can i ask you a question
well of course stanley what is it
what's a  homosexual
hoh well stanley i guess you came to the right person sit down  stanley gay people well gay people are evil evil right down to their cold black hearts which pump not blood like yours and mine but rather a thick vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their peasized brains which becomes the cause of their naziesque patterns of violent behavior do you understand
i guess
good i'm glad we could have this little talk stanley now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual
you guys see me block that defense today i was kicking ass
you're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the cowboys
hey speaking of pounding ass here comes stan's little homo dog

atta boy spark get her  yes  ah crap now what do i do
who cares if your dog is gay maybe it's not that bad
no way dude my mom says god hates gay people that's why he smote those sodomies in france

kill that ken kill that ken
hello everyone this is frank hammond south park public radio am  welcome to tonight's matchup between the middle park cowboys and the south park cows  well it looks like chef the south park cows coach looks a little nervous this is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up

fine how are you
i'm super thanks for asking
my gay dog ran away and i was wondering if maybe he came here
well let's see come on in hmm
d'you have lots of gay dogs here

rooaar
and we have gay water buffalo gay hummingbirds here's a gaggle of gay gooses hi fellas it's so super to see you
wow seems like the animals here are really happy
of course they are silly buns it's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves would you like to dance
oww we can both be gay

the ball is snapped middle park blitzes  fumble middle park gets the ball they run it in for a touchdown the score is nothing middle park with  remaining in the first quarter
hell's bells
why i haven't seen a beating like that since rodney king
now frank that's not very pc you're gonna get us in trouble again

sorry sorry
okay stan i think you should get in line for my big gay boat ride  step aboard stanley  hello everyone and welcome aboard the big gay boat ride on this adventure we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time
and the south park cows are set to receive  there's the kick it's taken by number  kenny mccormick  he's at the  the  the
hold him hold him  hold him hold him
yaaah
the running back is down i think he's  yes he's been decapitated
wha oh my god they killed kenny you bastards
that's gotta hurt frank
how terue
hey come on that was roughing at least let us scrape him off the field
looks like the south park cows aren't even gonna beat the  point spread not by a long shot
you see gayness has existed since the beginning of time from the egyptian pharaohs to the shoguns of japan  uh oh look out it's the oppressors christians and republicans and nazis oh my  ohhh oh god that was close okay let's steer our big gay boat out of here and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely
we're all gay and it's okay'cause gay means happy and happy means gaywe're not sad anymore cause we're out the closet doorit's okay hey to be gay
sooo what do you think stan
this kicks ass i'm sorry i tried to change you spark i just didn't understand

hey stan where'd you get that black eye
nothing i mui mean nowhere
your sister beat you up again huh
no
eheh you know heh your sister kicked your ass
she's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist  she's taking it out on me
yeah but that sucks to get your butt kicked by a girl stan
i would never let a woman kick my ass  if she tried anything i'd be like hey you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie
my parents don't even believe that she beats me up  they think she's all innocent and sweet but i know that she's an evil bitch
be a man stan  just say hey woman yeyou shut your mouth and make babies
hey kyle what's that elephant doing
you mean this one
yeah
he's my new pet elephant
whoa dude  where'd you get a pet elephant
i got it mail ordered from africa  the ad said it would take  to  weeks but it only took three
wow that's cool
no it's not cool  my mom won't let me keep him in the house  she says he's too big and that his poop is bigger than our couch
that's why my mom got me a potbellied pig  cause its poop is small
hey you guys i talked to garrison and he told me that they're almost the same
well yeah but pigs aren't smart like elephants
hey  wait a minute  what is that thing
uh oh this this is the new retarded kid
ohi'm sorry little girl  but you still can't get on  you have to take the special ed bus
boy it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant  see ya
if a woman ever gave me crap i'd say hey you go do my laundry and
sit down kid
yes ma'am
and now children our friend mr hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering
that's right mr garrison genetic engineering is an exciting new science  you can splice the dna from some animals and make them better
mr garrison
yes kyle
with genetic engineering can you make an elephant smaller
well uh ye yes i suppose you could  you could splice elephant genes with a dog or cat or a potbellied pig genes
that's it  i'm going to combine my elephant with a potbellied pig and makepotbellied elephants  they'd be smart like elephants but small like pigs
that'd be cool
i want a potbellied elephant
yes i'll pay fifty dollars for one
that's stupid
shut up terrance we can genetical engineer anything we want
oh yeah i bet i can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig
i'll bet you can't
watch me plebeian
well spank my ass and call me charlie  isn't this exciting two a students in a cloning war
yes mr garrison genetic engineering lets us correct god's horrible horrible mistakes like german people
you know you boys might want to visit the genetic engineering ranch outside of town for some help  and you could both use this for your science fair projects next month
genetic engineering ranch  sweet
wait wait  we still need a pig
we can use cartman's pig
ehh you leave fluffy out of this
we're not gonna hurt her we just need some of her blood
you're not using any of fluffy's blood or else i'll kick you in the nuts  kyle kyle no
uh uhuh stanley can i talk to you for a minute
okay
i couldn't help but notice that black eye you have  are there problems at home
yes
oh dear  here stanley sit down have some cocoa and tell your friend mr hat all about it
i'm your friend mr hat stan  you can tell me anything  now who hits you is it your father or your mother
oh neither  it's my sister
your sister  oh for pete's sake don't be such a little wuss  stop wasting mr hat's time with pansy little foofoo problems and give me back my cocoa
let's open the phone lines back up for some questions
hey
yeah is this jesus
yes my son
hi shelly
are you looking at my headgear
headgear  what headgear
are you looking at my headgear
oh uh gosh uh i didn't really notice
you little liar
no i think it looks terrific  it matches your aaaaah
ready to go stan
go where
to the genetical engineering ranch
we got cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's
nobody's splicin' nothing from fluffy
i swear i'm gonna kill you stan
why's your sister so mean to you dude
yeah if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass i'd be all like hey listen missy eh yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before i slap you in the face
who said that
this must be it
well looks like nobody's home  guess we should come back some other time
no cartman we're going in there and splicing fluffy and my elephant together
it's okay fluffy i won't let them hurt you
it's just a stupid pig
yeah quit being such a baby
baby  well at least i don't get my ass kicked by a girl
at least i'm not a little pigfucker
hey  i'm taking my pig andscrew you guys  i'm going home  this whole idea's stupid anyway
what the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid you never get higher than a 'd'
hey  why don't you go back to san francisco with the rest of the jews
there's no jews in san francisco you retard
i'll kick you in the nuts
can i help you
mmmmmm
uhyeahwe want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig
brilliant idea huge elephantsized pigs
no no no  we want to make little potbellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets
ohh that's an even better idea  come on in
i'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering
eh it's okay fluffy nobody's going to hurt you
it's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger disease pollution even war  i have created things that will change the world for the better  for instance here is a monkey with four asses
mhhh
how does that make the world better
and here of course is my four assed ostrich  and my four assed mongoose
do you have anything besides just animals with four asses
oh uh i suppose so uh  oh yes over here  here i have rats splice with ducks and gorillas spliced with mosquitos and here i have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish
heyyy these bunny ears are tied on with little strings
and over here swiss cheese spliced with chalk and a beard
well what about our potbellied elephant
oh  well i'm sorry children but pig and elephant dna just won't splice  haven't you ever heard that song by 'loverboy'
which song is that
diindoon  pig and elephant dna just won't splice  although maybe i could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours
you can keep your hands off of fluffy's ass
you know it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days
ow
hmm  what  oh excuse me
wait what are you taking stan's blood for
oh pardon me i tripped  could i have some hair please
watch out stan  genetic engineers are crazy
come on fluffy
this fish is just hurting my anus
naw it's pretty fresh
uuuuhh  i sure am hungry
'ello gentlemen any of you blokes know what's for lunch today  lunchy munchies hmmm
go away pip nobody likes you
yeah what kind of name is pip anyway
well my father's family name being pirrip and my christian name being phillip my infant tongue
god damnit would you shut the hell up  nobody gives a rat's ass
yeah go away pip
righto
gah french people piss me off
hey dumbasses  you morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet
no we're already halfway done
halfway then all you've got is a stupid pig
yeah it's probably a gay pig too
stupid gay pig
it's more than you've got
wroong we've already got our human clone well under way
oh my god they cloned a foot
ughhey i'll kick your ass
eho
by friday we're gonna clone a whole human being  good luck with your stupid little pig
hello there children
hey chef
how you doin'
bad
why bad
we need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant but their genes won't splice
ahhhh of course they won't splice children haven't you ever heard that song by 'loverboy'
dooodnnndoodnn  a pig and an elephant dna just won'ta pigelephant  say now that's not a bad idea
i told you guys
imagine a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house  children we could make a fortune with this
you hear that dudes we'll be rich
forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge if you want to combine a pig and an elephant just get them to make sweeet love
whaaat
i don't think an elephant would make love to a pig
i don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant
sure they would  but you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood
so how do we do that
do what i do get 'em goood and drunk
hey uh you guys want to come over to my house
we've got work to do stan i think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk
really you you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit
why  is your sister gonna kick your ass again
shut up cartman
or are you gonna hit her with your hand
yeah stan she's just a girl
yeah if some girl tried to kick my ass i'd be like hey why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy i don't even know on my dad's bed
cartman what the hell are you talking about
i'm just saying you're just a little wuss that's all
stan you can use family love as a weapon against shelly  the next time she's gonna kick your ass just tell her shelly you're my sister and i love you
and i want to see you handling your breasts
sick dude she's my sister
try it  we'll see you in a while we got to go get cartman's pig
no you don't gotta get cartman's pig  you leave fluffy out of this
come on kenny
kyle no seriously  no fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my fluffy ikyle i will kick you in the nnnnuts
crap
and now back to jesus and pals on south park public access
are you staring at my neckbrace
no i mean yes i mean what neckbrace  shelly before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again i just want you to know thatthat you're my sister and i love you  no  ahh  someday shelly i'm gonna be bigger than you and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me
you'll never be bigger than me stan  never
beautiful it's absolutely beautiful my son i think we've finally done it
yes we have dad my very own human clone
hopefully not a gay clone
yeah that was stupid
stupid
that was stupid
come on elephant keep drinking
damn i wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig
dammit this is never gonna work
hello children  i thought i'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going
rotten they're both really drunk but the won't have sex
ohh children you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant and and expect them to do the mattress mambo you need to set the mood let me show you boys what i'm talking abouttonight is aright for loveyou know i  want tuh touch you where the lights don't gotonight is aright for love love gravyexpressing love so sweeti want tuh  keep you burnin' like a dog in heattonight is aright for love love graaavaaayladies and gentlemen mr elton john

dad you're the best
oh my god  he only has one ass  he's of no use to me i'll have to burn the room  oh no this entire expriment is turning out very bad
me bad
eeegads he's out of control  we'll have to destroy him
but he's our science fair project
uhhh me baad ababachewychomp
he's too dangerous son
but dad  i want a human clone
son no  oh son you've made a horrible mistake  you've put all the people of south park in jeopardy
they're all stupid anyway  come on guys let's go
yeahh they're all gay
aren't they ever gonna wake up
oh they will  it's gonna be one uuuugly sight
i thought you said the wonder of mother nature was a beautiful thing
yeah when does mother nature go from beautiful to ugly
usually about  in the morning children  uh oh here we go  yeahhh there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig  or a big fat elephant
hey how do we know if she's pregnant
well boys we might not know that for a couple of days
couple of days  but terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow
well good job einstein why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime  hey
oh thank buddha i found you boys  you must tell me have you seen anything odd lately
uh we saw an elephant have sex with a pig
no no i said odd
hey you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill
sir if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazythenuhhhhhhmmmoh nevermind  i'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch  you see i've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there and he's broken free
a big mutant stan
a big mutant version of me
is he bigger than a regular clone
he's terribly dangerous  his brain is identical to yours  i need you to help me find him
ah chewychewychomp
oh my gooodd
stan are you wearing a different hat
uhhhyahhuhhh
hey i know a certain young man who's itching for a detention  aaaaaah  ooooh

i bet he weighs four hundred pounds
come on stan don't you even know where you would go
look at that  what's he doin'
oh my god

thanks tom police are requesting that if you see this little eightyear old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body  that's all for now
now back to jesus and pals
yea the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and
babachompbetchabachewychewychompaaah
jesus
itstotheleftmayoueyea
officer barbrady my evil genetic clone is destroying the town  we have to find him
you boys have been watching the xfiles too much there's no such thing as genetic clone
ahhhh
whoa  listen uh you kids go on home there's nothing to see here
come on let's go
there you are  stanley you tore up my entire gun shop you better have a good explanation for this mister
it wasn't me uncle jimbo it was my evil genetic clone
stanley what the hell has gotten in to you  you have got severe lunchroom duty mister
i'm gonna go have a word with your father stanley

ah
what the hell do you want
chewychewychomp  ahhh  uhhh
boys boys i'm lusciously sorry for everything
hey they've got our clone  he belongs to us
no son this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere  boys i'm sorry i've caused you such  inconvenience  i tried to play god and i failed
daddy nooooo
all i ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful but i failed  perhaps we shouldn't be toying with god's creations  perhaps we should just leave nature alone to its simple one assed schematics
you cheating bastards  this isn't over just wait until tomorrow
oh my god they killed kenny you bastards
mom and dad are home  my house is a disaster you guy you guys have got to help me
i ain't helpin' crap  i want to eat some paeh

everyone let's give k c and his weed a big hand  okay kyle we're ready to see your science project
well our pig hasn't given birth yet but she should anytime now
oh well then i guess you get an 'f'  okay terrance i know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project
thank you mr garrison  boys mr garrison fellow students for our science fair project bill fosse and i have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man  i present to you the fiveassed monkey
ahhheh
oh mr hat isn't it beautiful
wait wait the pig just gave birth  it it had a baby
it had a baby
oh wow

you're exactly right terrance oh
oh no
ha ha ha that's sweet
eric dear i just got a call from your friend kyle's mother she said that this show is naughty and might make you a potty mouth
that's a bunch of crap kyle's mom is a dirty jew
ohhh okay hon
i'm not going to kill you grampa
ingrate
good night grampa
you pompous son of a whore
huh huh i had another
ow what the hell was that for
that's for your stupid mother she made me miss terrance  phillip last night
yeah what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night
well i didn't have her do it she did it on her own
why does this happen every month it seems like right around the same time every month kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and i always end up getting screwed by it
children children a certain student's mother called me last night
oh gee i wonder who's mother that could have been
she informed me that some of you might be watching a a naughty show called terrance  phillip
yeahh woohoo
watching that show is bad mr garrison
that's right mr hat shows like terrance  phillip are what we call 'toilet humor' they don't expand your minds  you see children these kind of shows are senseless vile trash  kenny why are you late to class  oh okay kenny be seated  now as i was saying the reason that parents of south park are so upset is because  yes kenny what is it
i have to go pee
i thought you just came from the bathroom
i did i gotta go again
okay okay go ahead  as i was saying you all seem to enjoy this show even though it isn't based in reality there's much more to life than two young men farting on each other and throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad and usually they get taken right off the air you see you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment
whoa smells like you slaughtered a cow in there kenny
pay attention children  i'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch terrance  phillip any more ever
what
not watch terrance  phillip ever
that's right children are there any questions  yes stanley
is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to
what what do you mean
my grampa keeps asking that i kill him all the time and sometimes i wonder if i should
well then you should i think that a person has a right to die if they wanna
really
yeah there's this guy named jack leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to and he doesn't get in any trouble at all
wow
hey maybe we can get him to kyle's mom
so is it okay to assist somebody with suicide mr garrison
uh stan i'm not touching that one with a twentyfoot pole
oh my god  owww
man i can't believe we're gonna miss terrance  phillip today i think i'm already having withdrawal
don't worry dude we can all go watch it at my house my parents don't get home until late
but won't your grampa be there
yeah
just kill 'im dude maybe he'll give you some money
hello there children
hey chef
how's it goin'
bad
why bad
chef is it okay to kill your grampa
you can't kill my grampa stan he's already passed on

see i told you dude
well yeah but what if the grampa wants to die cause he's really old and he's just asking for help
yeah like assisted suicide what about that
i don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole
what's the big deal why won't anybody talk about this
and i myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently i have a clip to demonstrate exactly what i mean
hey phillip guess what

not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough we need to boycott the entire network all those in favor

boys how did you get driven so far to the edge what changed you into such demonic little bastards
we didn't know what we were doing we were just sitting there watching terrance  phillip and
terrance  phillip aha so it is that show that is to blame
these boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see and we are fed up
woooo
huh oh god oh god
we have to stop this smut from going on the air we will march to the network and protest until our demands are met new york here we come
we are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television for our children  we want more quality television like full house
oh i think you gave me the stomach flu mr garrison
no no it was that little kenny bastard that gave it to me
whoa mayor you uh making gravy in there heh heh heh heh
i just had a brown baby boy
dude this is sweet not having parents around
yeah i hope they protest tv shows forever
whoopeee
come here billy i want to show you something
aww do i have to
yes you do you little pecker i realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how i feel billy but now i found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa

i don't know
now you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me are you ready billy

so now will you kill me billy
sure i will grampa i will
hehh it doesn't look like our protest is working
it'll work it has to
look it's the president of the network
ladies and gentlemen my name is john warzog i've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network  fuck you  thank you ladies and gentlemen if there are any questions you may direct them to that brick wall over there
hey you will not get away with this  that does it no more mr nice protesters it's time for 'plan b'

death
mrrrrr
it's about time you lazyass son of a whore  come on let's go  what the
hey he's coming towards us
why is death coming after us
mrrr
ahhh
aaaah runrunruuun
mrrr
what are we gonna do
mooorrrr
as the day progresses more and more south park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'toon central building toon central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show and has already lost over  of their sponsors
here carol i think it's your boy
oh thanks what is it stanleyhon did you break something
mom death is here and and he's trying to take us all away with him
stanley honey you need to leave mommy alone i'm doing something very very important for your little wellbeing there
yeah but mom
here honey talk to your father
did you turn the heat down
dad death is coming
keep the thermostat under  and take care of your grandfather
mrrrr
dammit you know i think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on tv and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives this world would be a much better place
yeah i think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids
you know what i think basically if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control then what can you see it'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids
totally dude
good point man
mrrrr
ahhhh
quick jump through the window
ehh eh ehhhh
mrrrr

children children to honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive does anybody know what a canned food drive is  yes eric
when they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out
noo that's a caesarian section eric but that's okay remember there are no stupid questions just stupid people  a canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on thanksgiving
you mean like kenny
exactly
mr garrison why do poor people always smell like sour milk
i don't know eric they just do  now children i want each of you to bring in one can of food and later the mayor of south park will divide it up amongst kenny's family and other poor people
i'm not bringin' in food for poor people screw them
don't you want to help those who are less fortunate
hey you guys do you hear something ah i think i hear the flower children calling
this is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat
isn't it enough that i pay taxes what about the poor houses that that i pay for
many would rather die than go to those places
well then perhaps they should and decrease the surplus population
okay kids that's enough dickens for one day let's get on with our lesson right mr hat
that's right mr garrison englebert humperdink was the first person on the moon who was the second
aaaah
what the hell is going on
aaaah
well you don't see that everyday
okay now once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor
it should be something festive
mayor we've got a very big problem
ahh you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill right
yes and i may have made a horrible mistake i was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for thanksgiving
uh huh
you know to provide food for the needy
of course
well something went wrong and the turkeys broke free and the worst part is they're really pissed off
naturally  oh do go on
we have to stop them or or they could destroy everything time is short
you were saying
they act just like normal turkeys except they're evil
oh my
somehow i don't think you're taking me seriously
uh now why would you say that
did it come did it come is it here yet
i get to use it first you guys  mom did our digital sports watch come yet

children children i'm a little disappointed in your thanksgiving spirit only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive  and can't we do a little better than  creamed corn  uh  creamed corn  and  creamed corn  please bring in more diverse food children or else kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny thanksgiving  cornygravycorny thanksgiving hoo hahhaa anyway children i understand a few of you have brought in something special for showandtell
yeah yeah we do
yeah that's right
we do
all right boys show us what you've brought
this is our new ethernopian starvin' marvin
he can do really cool stuff with his voice show 'em starvin' marvin
no starvin' marvin that's kenny's creamed corn  no starvin' marvin that's a bad starvin' marvin
boys what the hell are you doing this is horribly horribly wrong how did you get this child

the sports watch from the commercial
yeah that one
i want a starvin' marvin
me too
yes i'll pay fifty dollars for one
yeah i want one too yeah me me
boys you're too young to take care of a child i'm afraid i'm going to have to call the red cross and have him returned
ah i told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude
okay thank you very much yes you can pick him up tonight bye now  now boys i hope you've learned your lesson
no
you can't care for this child
but i thought we were supposed to care on thanksgiving
yes but you don't actually get involved with the child's life you're supposed to just send money and once in a while they write you a letter you see marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like south park
so why can't he live here now
because he can't
because why
because eightyear olds can't be parents
then you take care of him
i can't i ummi'm very busy  i send my five dollars a month see
this sucks starvin' marvin is our friend
oh well back to the poor country with you
you better watch what you say cartman you might be poor and hungry some day

uhh i seeean extreme close up of vanessa redgrave's private parts
oh whoops  now tell me what you see
well i'm no biologist but i'd say it looks like turkey dna
precisely but look how rapidly it's dividing
what does it mean
means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate if we don't destroy them all they'll take over the town maybe the world
oh fudge  uhh let me see that vanessa redgrave thing again

well i'm trying to direct the school christmas play but your son was holding the baby jesus fetus by the head
how dare you include the nativity in a school play  don't you realize my son is jewish
so
so what makes you think he should play joseph of arimathea
because it's christmas
our family doesn't celebrate christmas
ogod you're not gonna lay that channukah crap on me are you
whatwhatwhaaat you're not going to get away with this mr garrison
oh dude  kyle's mom is here to ruin christmas
shut up fat boy
i'm not fat i'm festively plump
why are you jewish on christmas kyle
okay  kyle is there anything you can do for the christmas play that isn't related to jesus
how about the dreidl song bubbe

mr hankey the christmas poohe loves me and i love y
christmas poo
what the hell is christmas poo

we'll catch up with you later kyle
wait  i may not have santa but i do have mr hankey the christmas poo
whawhat is this about christmas poo dude
mr hankey  he comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet

mayor we are deeply offended by the nativity scene in front of the capital office church and state are separate
no wrong
what's going on you guys
the whole town's pissed off at each other  it's really sweet
that isn't all mayor  the school play is doing a nativity scene  it isn't being sensitive to the jewish community
you are the jewish community
yeah  yeah
oh boy  superbitch is at it again
don't call my mom a bitch cartman
mayor the nativity is what christmas is all about  if you remove christ you must remove santa and frosty and all of that garbage too
hallelujah
amen
and we must put a stop to the cutting down of christmas trees
raah
give me a break
and i'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids  if you don't want to spill your coffee you shouldn't be driving with it

okay people we clearly need to reach a compromise  perhaps we need a new icon for christmas
oooo brilliant idea mayor
hey  how about mr hankey the christmas poo

haven't you ever been curious about the insanity barbra streisand exhibits
well i always heard she was kind of a bitch but
more than a bitch she's a calculating selfcentered egotistical bitch she was born in a small town her mother was a jackal and her father was an insurance salesman
woohoohoohoo an insurance salesman
when she was five she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer but by the time she was six her ambitions became to rule the univese she learned of an ancient diamond the diamond of pantheos
okay you know what never mind i don't need to know all this  forget i asked
before she was seven the keepers of pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish the diamond was split up and buried at opposite ends of the world but then during the shooting of my fair lady barbra streisand found one of the triangles
and the other triangle is the one that little kyle has
yes mr chef if babs gets ahold of that other triangle she will fulfill her prophecy and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind mechastreisand
megastreisand oh man i don't know what the hell that means but it doesn't sound good
man the bus sure is late

what why
hey don't worry about that take a load off don't worry about it look over here all i need is for celine dion to sing our iranian national anthem at the game  to finalize my hostile takeover of canada what do you say
did you say hostile takeover of canada
no no relax there fella
well scott said to meet him here but he's not showing up
well while we're waiting why don't we search for treasure
oh good idea let's search for treasure
what are you idiots doing
we're looking for treasure
is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described
no we're searching for treasure
listen i have an inside scoop there's an iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over canada
yes you mean saddam smelly we saw him on the telly
well what are you two gonna do aboat it
what do you mean
it's your fault that he's here you brought the iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter
you mean we are to blame
that's right and now you must make amends tomorrow saddam will try to finalize his takeover of canada at the roughridersroughriders football game it will be your only shot at wiping them all out here take this
what is this
it's a bomb  you must strap it to yourselves go to the game and sacrifice your lives to take out saddam's minions
that plan's scary
well you must do it for canada
for canada terrance
for canada phillip
yes terrance and phillip and when the dust is settled canada will be rid of both the iraqis and your immature fart humor
well phillip i am very sad that we have to die for canada
yes this bomb will blow us both to smithereens but we really have no choice only our deaths can bring canada life
that's funny
hey wait a minute that fart gives me pause
why is that
that smelly saddam hussein he uses germ and chemical warfare does he not
yes apparently he does
terrance get the phone book we must call every canadian we can
oh phillip it sounds like you have an idea
i do terrance
and the roughriders are giving the roughriders a run for their money  all else aside i must say that the roughriders  are simply outmatched by these roughriders  and that's going to take us to halftime be sure to stick around for the halftime show saddam and the electric iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers
well i guess it's time old friend
yes prepare the alert
hello to my canadian friends everybody relax take a rest lift your feet up those dogs are barking  you may have noticed some changes to your country don't worry about that the changes will continue i'm here to announce once and for all that canada will now be known as new baghdad qoloh qalah  you will bow down to me as your ruler you will obey my laws or you will be killed  and now you will sing the iraqi national anthem  or you will be stabbed in the head

we can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety
uh where are our children
officer barbrady let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town what would he do
hmmm that's a good question mayor let me get right on that with thinking
mayor mayor
the press is here
my name is sid greenfield i'm the director from los angeles for america's most wanted
youuu certainly made it up here quickly
we're desperate for stories  aand this one is so compelling
really
sure this story has everything people furniture talkingih it's a real american story
hey i thought of something  uh no wait that's subtraction
mr director person what exactly do you want to do
mayor shouldn't we be focusi
shh
we just want to do a recreation of the story for our show then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter that's it you win we win america wins
are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous
don't worry mayor america's most wanted is not about violence it's about family
it is
weelll in that case i guess it's okay
great we'll get started with auditions immediately what part should we cast first
who will the director cast first will it be mr garrison officer barbrady chef
i want to have an abortion
uoh well we can do that this must be a very difficult time for you mrs
cartman yesuh it's such a hard decision but i just don't feel i can raise a child in this screwy world
yes ms cartman if you don't feel fit to raise a child then abortion probably is the answer do you know the actual time of conception
about eight years ago
i sseee so the fetus is
eight years old
ms cartman uh eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion
really

yes i'm afraid we're critically understaffed unless we get help soon all these people in here are completely fucked  metaphorically speaking that is
what about mephesto are you taking care of him
he's on full lifesupport and breathing fine he shouldn't need any help  so long as the power doesn't go out  oof who didn't see that coming a mile away huh

what the bueh eric roberts is improvising lines again
i'm going to get the man to a hospital who will help me
this is not a world i want to live in doesn't anyone want
goddammit  what the hell is this
we've lost the feed to la
uuuhm wewe seem to have lost our linkup to the south park crew sso i guess we'll be going to our featured movie who framed roger rabbit
who framed roger rabbit was it jimbo mr garrison chef
somebody go see why we lost the hookup
holy smokes that blizzard is getting crazy
don't panic anybody the power lines are down but the backup generator is running just fine
nurse i could use some help in here
coming
ladym is mephesto gonna be okay
yes for now but i'm afraid the generator won't run for long the batteries run out in half an hour time is very short
nurse please i need another pair of hands in here  oh sorry
don't you see governor i should have a right to have an abortion if i want one
mmaarr i don't knowuh i might need some more convincing hmhmhm
i mean what right do i have bringing another child into this overpopulated world then again i should've thought of that before having sex then againuh oh i just don't know
please mr chef i've over  people to attend to anand only myself and nurse goodly
what do you want me to do
do you know anything about surgery
i used to watch quincy
what why the hell didn't you say so put on some scrubs boys i'm making you all honorary doctors you can help us save these people's lives
no way dude
well  we're not going anywhere for a loong time
we're snowed in
yes we're trapped
like sailors on a submarine
my god this is the worst storm i've ever seen
oh i have to get out of here i haven't eaten since breakfast
yeah i'm gettin' hungry too
i hope you all realize what we might be facing here  our only option might be to eat each other to stay alive
uuuhh it's only been like four hours aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly
that's a lot of lead mr director i don't eat pretty but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive so be it
buut how do we decide who
well we draw straws
now wait a minute we all had a big breakfast can't you people go without eating for a little while
calm down soldier we need every person here to keep his head barbrady fetch some straws
well who the hell made you the boss anyway
who the hell made jimbo boss was it barbrady chef mr gar
miles' appendix has burst i have no choice but to operate now with our limited power i need you all to be strong for me  nurse goodly will take care of the anesthesia chef you act as her arms  boys you have to help with suction and bandages ready
no
okay first i'll make an incision on the chest over the heart
oh boy  bleech
duhuhude you barfed into the incision
sweet
suction
hey who's screwing with the lights
who is screwing with the lights is it barbrady or jimbo or the  denver broncos
that is really starting to piss me off
alright so far everybody has a long piece of straw we'll keep drawing  whew
whew
wooo
wait a minute where the hell is the short one
the short what
dammit barbrady when you draw straws you're supposed to have one of them short that's how you decide who loses
that's not how i played it
uuugh could we hurry this up my stomach is growling
i found a map that shows the location of a backup generator apparently they built a large selfsustaining generator for just this kind of emergency but it's out and away from the hospital
so how do we get to it
we must split up into two teams team a and team b team a will consist of myself stan kyle eric chef and nurse goodly team b will consist of kenny  now listen closely team b your goal will be to turn on the backup generator to do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct  meanwhile team a will go to the holding area here  where there is a television and some cocoa we will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until team b makes it through the sewage duct by that time team b remember that's you kenny should reach the outer core of the generator it will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top and there could be velociraptors here  once you reach the top you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television then you could proceed down into the generator and power it on are there any questions
nnoh that sounds pretty sweet to me
great then let's do it go team
huh
i can't go on eh so hungry
we're all going to die in this horrible place
we have to have the energy to make it through the night we have to eat
how can we how could we live with ourselves
there's only one answer eat eric roberts
yes of course nobody gives a shit about eric roberts
eat eric roberts
no no please
well there's no going back now  we're cannibals  god save us
god wants you to live mayor fight
well i have to admit eric roberts was much juicier than i expected
aaww
this snow just isn't letting up we're gonna die here i know it
what time is it barbrady
it's almost midnight
oh i can't go on
we'll give the storm another hour after that we might have to eat again
what christ are you people diabetic or something
team b come in team b
this is team b
listen team b we've found another path to the generator there's actually a nice heated walkway to it so you don't need to walk through all that sewage
are you fuckin' telling me that i could've fuckin' gone that way
oh well forget i said that then listen team b you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left
yup i see it in the drift
good head towards it team a out
what if mephesto never wakes up and i never find out who my father is
my god what a harrowing tale of human drama this is all of us doing what we must to survive
it is amazing what people can do under stress just look at the pyramids nobody knows how they built those or who
who built the pyramids was it the babylonians officer barbrady samaritans
okay i've reached the generator
roger team b  he's reached the backup generator  team b can you see the two copper nodes
roger
good now is there a wire connecting them
negative
damn the wire connecting the nodes is gone we need to complete the circuit between them or we're screwed
d'you have any wire here
there's no time once these lights flicker out all the patients on lifesupport are going to die
i'll stick 'em together
no kenny you can't there must be some other way he's going to make the connection himself with his hands
no he'll die
go kenny
kenny nnnoooooo
goodbbyyyyeeugh
oh my god they've killed kenny
you bastard
the power
quickly get the scanner running again  we've got a chance now
well okay mrs cartman i'll legalize th trimester abortions for you
oh thank you thank you
we'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately
terminated
why yes that's what an abortion is
oh no uh i didn't mean that i meant the other thing you can dowhat's that other a word
adoption
yess that's what i mean adoption
well that's pretty different
oh i should tell my son the truth about everything myself good day mr president
well we made it the power is on the snow is melting and your friend mephesto is doing fine
where where am i
you're at the hospital mr mephesto you were shot now we don't know who tried to shoot you but
ohh i'm sure it was my brother again he tries to shoot me every month
ooohhh
where's the little fat boy he'll be delighted that mephesto's awake
he went off looking for mr kenny
he was a good friend and i'll miss him
he was very brave he risked his life so that mephesto could live
yeah and now he's a freezypop
dude d'you think if we hit him with a shovel he'd shatter
i don't know let's find out
ohh it's over we're free
yes but at what cost mr garrison at what cost
listen everybody we did what we had to in there
but hhhow will we live with ourselves now
mmone day at a time mayor mmone day at a time
ave maria
well i'm bringing home some eric roberts in a doggie bag does anybody else want some
i'm glad that you could all come i can finally reveal who the father of eric cartman is but first i want to thank kenny mccormick for sacrificing his life
just tell us already
alright alright the father of eric cartman is say did anybody see that terrance and phillip special last month wasn't that just the funniest thing
dammit tell me who my father is already
oh as i said before the father is somebody in this room the father is mrs cartman
what
yes it's true
noo that doesn't make sense
yes it took quite a while for me to understand as well you see mrs cartman is a hermaphrodite
uhmeaning what
meaning that she has both male and female genitals
it's true
you mean at the drunken barn dance when we all got together with her she was a he
no no not exactly but she did have a penis  the fact of the matter is hermaphrodites cannot bear children so mrs cartman's dna match with eric can only mean that she is his father and she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance
ugh man this is fuckin' weak
dude you're a big fatass and your mom's a hermapholite
i'm sorry i never told you eric  i just thought maybe it would be a little shocking to you
oh wow gee whiz you think so mom
well that's that thank you all for playing
no no wait a minute if if she's my dad then who's my mom
who is eric cartman's mother is it mrs crabtree sheila broflovski the mayor
ooohhh forget it
okay children each of you gets to choose two books from the booktastic bus
reading sucks ass
eric shut up
boring boring gay boring boring
hey you guys check out these books  sabrina unchained

i don't know i'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these
hey what's that
i don't know let's go see
well being an officer of the peace means a lot of things it's a hard job but then i'm a hard man a lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do well they're wrong
all units all units report to  avenue de los mexicanos possible hostile situation
there you see this could be a bank robbery or possibly even a murder this ain't no podunk little town
and barbrady your wife called she wants you to get some pizza on the way home
goddammit
okay people move along there's nothing to see here  what's the trouble where's the body
barbrady i just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens

with chicken after chicken being violated the south park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the chickenfucker we now go live to a press conference where officer barbrady and the mayor are fielding questions
officer barbrady what would drive a man to such a disgusting act
well nobody can say for sure uh no motive has yet been established
do the police have any leads
well both d computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet
but has chickenfucker left any clues at the crime
all right all right i can't read  there i said it i can't read are you happy now you pushed and you pushed and now you all know my terrible secret i'm illegitimate i'm not fit to be a policeman i retire
okay thank you all for coming there's uhh coffee and brownies out front

whoopee this is killer
with no cops around we can do whatever we want
whoa dude what's going on

you mean i'm fired
well i guess that's the grownup way to put it yes

it was an error of judgment mr mackey but i'm afraid i have to let you go for it we searched each one of those kids but came up empty
but
we had to let them go home and one of them now has half a lid of jamaican grass because of you
huh how am i going to make ends meetmm'kay whawhat will i do for money

no dude we never even saw it
okay because i just want to tell you that drugs are bad
we know we know that's what everybody says
right but do you know why they're bad
because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits
and do you have any idea what that means
no
i know drugs are bad because if you do drugs you're a hippie and hippies suck
look children this is all i'm goin' to say about drugs stay away from them there's a time and place for everything and it's called college do you understand
dude

what don't you have dodgeball in france
well no and actually i'm not from france
look pip the rules are simple a kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball
oh dear
if the ball hits you you're out but if you catch the ball he's out and the last team to still have anybody standing wins
oh what jolly good fun
no it isn't it hurts i can't believe they let us play this in school
play ball
ow ahowowooooowww
dammit we lost one already
aheeheh you're out clyde heheheh
jordan swanson pull forward we need backup
aagghhh
we're losing men fast out here
concentrate on your gehame be the buhawhall
i caught it i caught it
great catch kyle now your team's on offense
here pip you throw
ugh oh no i couldn't
come on limey don't be a wuss are you just gonna be a little french pig your whole life
i'm not french
throw the ball you stupid frog  goddamn maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants  you'd be able to ow
okay that was pretty good pip but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team
ow my nose you broke my nose
damn pip i didn't know you had it in you
ogh i'm dreadfully sorry
that nose is bleeding pretty bad kyle i think you might have to go to the nurse's office
no no it'll be okay
sorry son you'll have to let the nurse look at it come on
oh noooo
dude he's going to the nurse's office
i heard the school nurse is hideously deformed
i heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch
stan has anybody actually seen the nurse and come back to tell about it
no cartman nobody ever has
are you kyle broflovski
yeyes
i'm the school nurse did you hurt your nose
yeyes
young man why do you have your eyes closed i'm not gonna hurt you
i know
so open them
oh  phew
now what seems to be the problem
aw i just hit my nose playing dodgeball
oh well i'll get you an ice pack
aaggggghhhh
what
ooooohhhhh my god
oh i see you've noticed my disorder i have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head
aaaarrrrgggggghhhhh
and when she moved up and down the little fetus jiggled
eewwww
did it talk the little fetus did it talk
no noit looked dead
eewwww
wawas it wearing clothes
dude where is she gonna get fetus clothes
oh yeah eeww
eewwww
and then she walked over to
kyle that is enough i've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition and it is nothing to be made fun of it's called conjoined twin myslexia
who the hell cares what it's called as long as she doesn't have to touch me
now that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against sit down boys  you see boys sometimes when babies are born they're born as twins but sometimes the twins get hooked together and they're born as siamese twins
gross
but sometimes after the siamese twins are joined together one of the twins dies before birth the living baby is born with the dead baby still attached  sometimes this dead twin is inside the living person so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it
agggggghhhhhh
agghhh let me live aggghhh
so now that you're educated about her disease you won't need to make fun of her right bubbe
uhhhh yeah
can you imagine that poor poor woman
mmhmm
feeling like an outcast being ridiculed every day
mmhmm
hello
hello sheila it's sharon stan's mother
oh yes hello sharon
sheila i was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick
no i have to get it out
well sharon i was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia
so this is your fault
arrrggggggghhhhhh
damn it stop  oh  damm it
would you do me a favor next time you want to scare the hell out of my child just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead
that does it i must educate the entire town about this awful disease
mmhmm
dude i don't get it why are we playing dodgeball again
yeah i thought we only played on fridays
children great news we've been asked to play in the state finals for dodgeball
awww
aw do we have to
can't we just play with that big parachute again or something
youyou don't understand children if we can win state we can play in the nationals in washington dc
heyh they have a zoo there
that's right now come on we have a lot of practicing to do
aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to state finals
hey pip do you wanna be on my team again
i'd love to
now let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time frenchy
hey i get quite disturbed when you call me that you shouldn't make fun of foreigners  and besides i hate french people
well mrs broflovski it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again what seems to be pissing you off today
nothing is pissing me off i just wanta start a movement
oof course you do
i want to talk to you all about your school nurse
uh nurse gollum is absolutely qualified to be a
no no no i'm not upset about her i want to make the public aware of her her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of
oh and uh what disease is that
uh principal victoria nurse gollum has conjoined twin myslexia
what's that
she has a dead fetus attached to her head
she does
yyou never noticed that
noo i never did
well that's exactly what i'm talking about this poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast it is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town
did you say a fetus sticking out from her head
i want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening i'd appreciate it if both you and mr mackey would attend
do we have to eat kosher stuff
well i'll talk to nurse gollum but i'm sure she'll be delighted let's say around
wonderful
now you did say she has a fetus on her head
okay children  now who's gonna win the state finals
denver
here we go caows here we go unh unhhere we go caows here we go unh unhi think we need to get off on this exit

how many times do i have to explain this to you i'm not a student you can't give me an office referral and
i said sit doowwn
yes ma'am
whoa dude this is a school
hello there i'm bob thomas the coach for the denver cougars

iit's okay ms broflovski really
please forgive us ii'm terribly sorry nurse gollum
no i'm quite secure with it
i have felt so bad ever since i heard the boys making fun of you
they're just young boys joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand
could i get some more pork
so did you ever think of just you know having it cut off
yes principal victoria the thought had occurred to me unfortunately it would mean my death
ooohh so i suppose that's out uhhow about a hat then
no really i don't need a
yes we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day no big whoop
i really appreciate what you're trying to do here but it's not necessary i'm a pretty happy person
i've got it we could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you
ooohh yeess a conjoined twin myslexia awareness week you know that has a nice ring
but i really don't think
ththe school could put out pamphlets m'kay and we could have seminars to educate m'kay

aggghhh
yes now we're about to roll the film but remember if you look the mexican staring frog in the eyes you could go catatonic we don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not but who wants to take chances so when we roll this film be sure to look away  okay roll the film tom  is it over okay it's over  well there you have it undeniable proof that the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka exists

just keep your trap shut i'll consult the manual
ms crabtree
shut up kiid i have to watch a training video
welcome to tape  of the bus driver's video guidebook what to do if you become stranded by now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or i'll kill the bunny' technique now it's time to get help the most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus so do not under any circumstances let any children off the bus the best way to achieve this is to tell them something like 'a big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus'
kiids do not get off this bus if you do a big scary monster will eat you
that's right with the children properly subdued you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance and remember your bus driver's code 'sit down and shut up'
i'm goin' for help ah'll be back as soon as i can remember don't get off this bus or a big scary monster will eat you
hey why doesn't the scary monster eat her
'cause dombass scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches
what did you say

hell everything's legal in mxico it's the american way
at the dyno might firework company we have a commitment to excellence  our focus is on safety while
just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake
oh okay  let's see  now the disk that we are making is approximately  times bigger than the average snake
ooooh
we'll have to fly it in with three comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake
comanche helicopters
then we'll need  flamethrowers all set up around the perimeter of the disk that are all triggered to fire at the same time
flamethrowers triggered at the same time
once lit the snake will grow  and good times will be had by all
wonderful
spectacular
well you see fireworks at the lake will not only go on but perhaps be the best ever wait a minute we're gonna need an orchestra to play the stars and stripes

mr hankey mr hankey is that you hello
i'm here live in south park colorado where citizens from los angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival this is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town  and so the excitement level is naturally very high right now the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of hollywood's top celebrities
it was him dude i told you it was mr hankey
wait i thought mr hankey only came at christmastime
well i'm sure it was him
look look here comes somebody
move aside i can't see
ladies and gentlemen tv's fred savage
aawwww
well i'm sure a real person will show up soon
so how was that movie last night dude
aw dude you don't even wanna know
it had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding huh
yeah pretty much
yeah
the theater sucks though they need to get a bigger screen
maybe they should project the movies on cartman's ass
ay
dude now that'd be like imax
okay that's enough fatass jokes for this week
cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room heheheheheh
okay that does it screw you guys i'm going home
well
i'm gonna just give me a minute
this is perfect why didn't we think of it sooner this town still has some charm left not the mess we turned park city into
forgive me for being observant but won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town
yes and the town after and the town after that like termites we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up and then move on until every quiet mountain town is like los angeles
why why would we do such a thing
because we have to live in la and if we can't live in quiet simple peaceful mountain towns then nobody will  waitwaitwait zoom in to a closeup of my face when i do that ready then nobody will  that's it
children i'm glad you're here i want you to check out my new confectioneries i think they're going to sell right through the roof i call them chef's salty chocolate balls

we have contracts  you try to pull out now we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got but thanks so much for the hard work
eh but but this doesn't make sense to me marty okay you told me the movie made a lot of money
mmp right two million minus your agent's fee minus your lawyer's fee minus my fee and the publicity and taxes taken out you get three dollars that's more than most people in your position make trust me
serves you right cartman you're a sellout
i'm not a sellout what's a sellout
if you work in the entertainment business and you make money you're a sellout

wait  i brought him i brought him to show you
oh not this again
behold mr hankey
hoooooowwwdyho
anyway this new hollywood planet will be the official meeting place for all
howdyho folks i'm afraid my buddy kyle was right there's not enough room in south park to accommodate a festival
mr poo if you wouldn't mind we can't hear our chairman if you could just turn yourself down you're at about  right now we need you at about  okay
uh folks please little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films we love havin' visitors but golly too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem besides folks film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold it should be about people gettin' together and watchin' movies and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched if only once a good film festival should be something where we all say gaw let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities let's forget all those things for just a while and just watch some new art
i have had enough of you
nyyaarrrr
no
now as i was saying this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals
ohoho he's dead mr hankey's dead
well it worked once before
hi chef your big chocolate balls are just the trick
what the hell is he doing
i don't know
whoa
oh my god
aaaaahh
oh my god it's crap
ohh noo
whoa it smells it smells
come on let's go it's coming
i'm trying damn it
aww aww glup
let's get out of this town
gosh i guess i don't know my own strength
you did it mr hankey you got rid of all the film people
hooray
ooh yeaah now all we have is a town covered in shit this is much better
i couldn't have done it without you kyle  kisses
stan i'm sorry i dragged you to all those independent films
oh that's okay wendy i forgive you
sometimes i forget that even though a few independent films are great most of them suck ass
yes and i've learned something too  being a sellout is sweet because you make a lot of money and when you have money you don't have to hang out with any poorass losers like you guys screw you guys i'ma goin' home
it's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time
but what's wrong with her
it's chickenpox there seems to be a small epidemic going around your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child i take it
no no she's been perfectly healthy
well that's the problem you see chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease
shelly look who's come to visit you your little brother stan
oh whoopeee
you know most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes
dude you've got herpes on your face
shut up brat
will my daughter be okay
she'll be fine
stop it
we just want to be cautious and monitor her here
ow
come on stanley give your sister a kiss and then we have to go
and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older my daughter is in pretty bad shape now but if she were in her twenties she could die
my god i never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness
i guess it's much better to get it when you're young
so tell me if i'm crazy but i started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox let them get it now while they're young
that's not crazy at all sharon mothers do it all the time
oh yes when i was a child my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox just so i would get it
so it's not such a crazy idea after all
noo no and i'm pretty sure that strange little boy kenny has the chickenpox right now
are you guys having a meeting or something
how would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend kenny's house tonight
no way dude kenny's family's poor they live in the ghetto
yeah let's just have a slumber party here
boys you're going to sleep over at kenny's and that's final
oh weak
i wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at kenny's so bad
yeah it's pretty weird
well all i can say is he's better have nintendo  well here's kenny's house
in the ghettoon a cold and gray chicago morn another little baby child is bornin the ghetto in the ghetto
yeah
we're here to have a slumber party with kenny

that's the whole point remember their moms want them to catch it while they're young
oh yeah

oh good i'm starving
let's say grace
lord we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us and since we have been faithful to you we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time amen

pfff
okay let's dig in
that one's mine that one's mine
what kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles  am i to understand there will be no side dishes
so kyle your dad's still bringing home those big fat lawyer paychecks
i don't know
stuart don't even get started
what i'm just askin' a question  you know your dad and i used to be best friends when we were teenagers we would work together at pizza shack but he got promoted and went off to community college and i didn't and you know why 'cause your dad's jewish
puh i heard that
that ain't why stuart  it's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night
hey is it my fault you don't know how to cook
what am i supposed to do with frozen waffles clamhead you put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em
you just don't know how to use spices and stuff
my waffle's dhun my waffle's dhuhun
now kevin we ain't got enough for everybody you have to split that with your brother
oh jesus are you fucking kidding me
hey we don't say fuck at the table you little asshole

aachoo

dude i think i just saw a rat
argh you have rats in your house too kenny

goody what do you mean goody
yyup it looks like you've got chickenpox alright

did you sleep in the same room

bubbe how would you like to spend the night at your friend kenny's house again
no way dude it sucked ass they don't even have cable
well i think you need to spend more time with your friends
kenny's not really my friend ma i don't give a rat's ass about him
i'm gonna give mrs mccormick a call
aawwww hey dad is it true that you and kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young
who stuart yeah yeah i guess we were
well how come kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor and we have a big house and lots of food
well because kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do
but why if they're hungry and poor why don't we just always give them half of our food
ha ha ha ha ha oohho boy have you got a lot to learn sit down son  you see kyle we humans work as a society and in order for a society to thrive we need gods and clods
gods and clods
yes you see i spent a lot of time going to law school and i was able to go because i have a slightly higher intellect than others but i still need people to pump my gas and make my french fries and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down
oooohh i see gods and clods
that's right so kenny's family is happy just the way they are and we're all a functioning part of america
stanley can i get you anything else  stanley oh my god randy randy hurry he's burning up
don't you worry stanley you're going to be okay

he'll be okay but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while
oh god what have we done
there there now it's not your fault
doctor weuuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early
oh wow you did wow you guys suck
could we go home now ma
no bubbeleh you play with kenny some more
but we've been playing for eight hours we can't think of anything else to do
i've got a great game for you it's called ookie mouth
what's ookie mouth
first you let kenny spit in your mouth then you try to swallow his spit and say ookie mouth at the same time
sick dude
no no bubbe it's loads of fun try it  that ought to take care of it
you want some more hot water
oh no thank you it's terrific though it's you don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water do you
naw we don't go for that hoidytoidy rich folk stuff
i see well you certainly have aab humble home mrs mccormick
yehah well unfortunately my husband is a washedup hunk of shit
oh i'm sorry to hear that
ookie mouth  gross i can't do it ma
try again bubbe
argh
you know your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers
oh they wuz best friends you couldn't separate 'em
really i met gerald in college so i didn't know what happened to them
oh they jus' grew apart i guess i think stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself
well that's too bad i'm sure your husband's a fine man
oh hell no he's a nugget o' deer turd
but if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore let's get them together
uhi don't know
we'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something
i can't say ookie mouth and have kenny spit down my throat at the same time it's impossible
practice makes perfect bubbe
dammit where's that calamine lotion

because they're a bunch of assholes
of course
come on dude we've gotta get out of here i don't know what they're planning next but it can't be good
i hope that one day america could be more like endor where the ewoks live endor is very cool  mom answer that they have trees and ewoks and barbecues which is why i like endor more than america it's cool
cartman do you remember how we all spent the night at kenny's a couple of days ago

cartman our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from kenny
yeah dude your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face

it's some kind of parental conspiracy our parents are trying to kill us or something
that bitch i'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts
